0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)
Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom
and dad, and I dont really know what happened with that."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr., (to Phoebe) Im your mother.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, Ehh?
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with
a guy like Chandler..."
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)"
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (voice-over) ...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really
know what happened with that either. "
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has
to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there
either... "
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, (surprised) Hi!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel and Bonnie, Hi!
0,season4,401jelly,Bonnie, Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Awww.
0,season4,401jelly,Bonnie, (to Rachel) Thanks a million.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Oh, youre welcome a million."
0,season4,401jelly,Bonnie," (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, Ill see you in our room."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, (softly) Oh my God.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, I know.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, Whoa! What?! Why?!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, Here?! Now?!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Well, yeah. I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in
there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Well, cant you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesnt work either, I
cant tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, I dont know.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasnt every morning."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Oh, making it worse!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Okay.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr., So I guess youd like to know how it all happened. 
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Noo! No! It wasnt like that I... Remember how I told you how
Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, How close?
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, I dont even know how that would work!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Well, we were..."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, (interrupting) Im not asking!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was
stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what its like to
be eighteen years old?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Yeah. Lets see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Well, Im so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best
parents in the world, I didnt even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years
ago, and by then you were already grown up. I dont know, youre here, and I
would, I would really, I would like to get to know you."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Yeah, well, everybody does! Im a really cool person. And y'know
you had 29 years to find that out, but you didnt even try! Y'know what, you walked
out on me, and Im just, Im gonna do the same thing to you."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr., Wait!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, I dont ever want to see you again! 
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, wheres my
purse?"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! Were out of soda.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," (jumping up) Oh, Ill go out and get you some."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Really?!
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whos
entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, I found a dried up seashores.
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," Sweety, what are you talking about?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Oh, my new Mom, who-whos a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go
upstairs)"
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Dont you wanna stay here and talk
about it?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," No. Im just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," (turning around, insistently) Monica!"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Oh.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Its over.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Oh, was it awful?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Well, it was loong. I didnt even realise how late it was, until I
noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop
themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didnt want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, I wrote you a letter.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," (handing him the letter) Its just some things Ive been
thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us
getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him
from making contact.) Wow, its-its 5"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Okay, Ill be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.
Very exciting."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the
letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why
didnt you come up?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Done!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, You just finished?
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," So umm, does it?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Im sorry.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, Does it?
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it?
part just another glance."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even think
about it..."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont have
to think about it, in fact, Ive decided, Ive decided that, that it.......does."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, Are you sure?
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Oh, sure! Im sure."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Ennnh.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, Ive got canned goods.
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Excellent hole, Joe."
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, Oh no! No!! My hole!!
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Its like two miles!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Yeah, and Im a little tired from digging the hole."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, Weve got to do something!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Well, theres really only one thing you can do."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, What?! What is it?!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, Youre gonna have to pee on it.
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, What?!! Gross!!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Dont blame me, I saw it on <i>The Discovery Channel</i>."
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia
in that, that like kills the pain."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Well forget it! It doesnt hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Well, Im ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel
cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod Yes.) Ohh!
Thats so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod No.) But for you, yay!
Ohh."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, How was the beach?
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," Nothing, I dont know."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, What happened?
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Nothing. Im gonna take a shower.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, Me too!!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, Me too.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Okay, Im gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, It does. It really and truly does.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong
in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful
to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say Well...)
(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break
up with you!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says
here, (reading from the letter) If you accept full responsibility... (to
Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does that
seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, No?
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If
you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, youre right. Yeah I guess
Ill let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Sure, its hard to forget! But that doesnt mean you have to
talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)
ever talk about."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, What the hell happened on that beach?!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Its between us and the sea, Ross!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula."
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula, Hey!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Okay, well umm, I know that we havent talked in a long time, but
umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom."
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula," Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, (shocked) You know her?!
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula," No, I umm, I read about her in Moms suicide note."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods Yes.) Well, do
you still have it?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula," (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in
Phoebes face.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, I cant believe you didnt tell me there was a suicide note!
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula, Yeah. So how have you been doing?
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," I, umm, shut up!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," (reading from the note) Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss
you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula," Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You
read the poem, right?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, Noooo!!
0,season4,401jelly,Ursula," All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment
and slams the door shut.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," Pass the cheese, please."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," My God, you cant even look at me! Can you?"
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, Nope.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?"
0,season4,401jelly,"Chandler, Monica, and Joey", NO!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," All right, thats it, you guys! What happened out there?"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross and Rachel, Come on!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, What happened? Joey?
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, All right. (gets up) 
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore wed never tell!"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, (running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! Its eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living
room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk."
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.
We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicas
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, I was in too much pain.
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, And then Joey remembered something.
0,season4,401jelly,Joey, Id seen this thing on <i>The Discovery Channel</i>...
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Wait a minute! I saw that! On <i>The Discovery Channel</i>, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe and Rachel, Ewwww!!
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," You cant say that!! You-you dont know!! I mean I thought I
was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldnt...bend that way.
So... (looks at Joey.)"
0,season4,401jelly,"Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel", (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help!
And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the
stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to
Chandler."
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the
screaming."
0,season4,401jelly,Joey," (laughs) Thats cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to
freak you out."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," (singing) ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my
bedroommmm. (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the
colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.
You go away."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Ill go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there
hasnt been a day where I didnt regret giving you up."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Okay, bye."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," No, Im not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the
reason I didnt look you up was, well I was afraid that youd react, just well
like, the way, the way youre reacting right now, and cant we just, y'know,
start from here?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, No.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.
Im family, Im it. Now, now Im done. (starts to leave)"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," But, its not like were losing anything. Y'know?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Yeah, I guess youre right."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Its not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything
in common."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Well, I dont know. I mean its not like we dont
have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe, I-I like pizza!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Oh my God, so do I!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," I knew it, wow!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr.," Ohh, so cute."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr., I know. Im mad at me too.
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry."
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe Sr., Hey! Me too!
0,season4,401jelly,Phoebe," All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out."
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Oh-hooo, I missed you."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, I missed you too.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to
everything, it just showed me how much youve grown. Y'know?"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, (getting miffed) I suppose.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never
thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Ooh, I just wish we hadnt lost those four months, but if time was
what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, You bet.
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," And for the record, it took two people to break up this
relationship!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," I didnt know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didnt finish the whole letter!"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, What?!!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, I fell asleep!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel, You fell asleep?!
0,season4,401jelly,Ross, It was 5
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Y'know I cant believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy
when youre at home on Saturday nights playing <i>Scrabble</i> with Monica!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Hey!!
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep
youre gonna miss wishing you were with me!"
0,season4,401jelly,Ross," Oh, no-no-no dont you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, (sets down some cards) Gin.
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler," We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this
game naked."
0,season4,401jelly,Monica, Will you stop!
0,season4,401jelly,Chandler, Okay. All right.
0,season4,401jelly,Monica," Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet,
and youre smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
0,season4,402cat,Joey," How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn
and slide."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired of
having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own
hands!"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," All right, how about we, how bout we sell it."
0,season4,402cat,Joey," All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet
to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as
decorations.)"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to
Joey) They seem all right with it!"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," (on machine) Hey Monica, its Chip."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Yesss!!
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Whos Chip?
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Shhh!
0,season4,402cat,Chip," (on machine) Good runnin into you at the bank today, so ah,
heres my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later."
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Chip, is Chip Matthews."
0,season4,402cat,Ross, The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Monica, youre so lucky! Hes like the most popular guy in
school!!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! Its Monica. (listens)
Kay. (listens) Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my
God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)"
0,season4,402cat,Ross, (to Rachel) I was just leaving.
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Good! Cause Ive got a product report to read, its like
eight pages, I hope I dont fall asleep."
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Why? Did you write it?
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (sees Chips phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants?"
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Well ah, actually..."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another
guy."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Well, umm, why dont you give him a call?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Oh, Im sure."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (on phone) Chip! Hi, its Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,
umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)
Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (whispering in her ear) Oh, thats right! He called to ask out
Monica! That-thats gotta be embarrassing! "
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily)
Thank you, thanks."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (reading the newspaper) Hey, heres a question; where did you guys
get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the
land."
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Im reading your ad.
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Looks good, uh?"
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine
Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Why? I love that thing.
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, You want it?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe and Rachel, Oh no.
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
0,season4,402cat,Joey, What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, (looks at him) Nooo.
0,season4,402cat,Joey, Oh. What do you do?
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Yeah, I actually dont know..."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Good, so do I"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Something to do with numbers?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over
and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cats eyes) Oh my God."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, What?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, Nothing. Nothing.
0,season4,402cat,Joey, What? Whats wrong?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my
Mother."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandmas glycoma medicine again?"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," No Dr. Skeptismo! Im sure. First of all, okay, theres the
feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My
Mothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then
nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to
the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an Oh my God. gesture) Oh, I
havent seen this smile in 17 years!"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni..."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, (interrupting) Let it go!!
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Umm, when were you gonna tell me that youre going out with Chip
Matthews?"
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Nooo! Its not okay! I cant believe you would want to after
what he did to me!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," What, that little thing at the prom?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex with
Amy Welch!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high
school."
0,season4,402cat,Monica," You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
0,season4,402cat,Monica, It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) "
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Oh, really?!"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?"
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Ill try.
0,season4,402cat,Ross, So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think
any of them are gonna work out."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Well, Im not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think shes worried that
y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)
Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Why cant you use the phone in here?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I
just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)"
0,season4,402cat,Ross," So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Ross, dont start."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that
theres a woman inside that cat!"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, I believe it.
0,season4,402cat,Ross, No you dont. 
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Yes, I do."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," I do not always have to beokay, okay. (starts to leave)"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, <i>Jurassic Park</i> could happen.
0,season4,402cat,Tony," Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!"
0,season4,402cat,Joey, Pretty nice?
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
0,season4,402cat,Tony," We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?
Weve got a canoe."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe."
0,season4,402cat,Tony, You gotta take the canoe!
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!"
0,season4,402cat,Peter," Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as
Tony chases after him)"
0,season4,402cat,Joey, (to Peter) Good for you!!
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (entering) You guys, youre never gonna believe what I just found
tacked up on a telephone pole! (Shes holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?"
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebes mother also goes by the name
Julio."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," You guys, theres a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I
mean, you know what that means?!"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Do we have to tell her?
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Yes, we have to tell her!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Oh, but its made her so happy."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have
dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
0,season4,402cat,All, (disappointed) Yeah.
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Thank you.
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, I hate when Ross is right!
0,season4,402cat,Monica," He is right, isnt he?"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong."
0,season4,402cat,All, You think?
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Oh-no, hes right."
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)"
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Hi!
0,season4,402cat,All, Hey!
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, Yeah?
0,season4,402cat,Joey, (pause) Hows that going?
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and
purred."
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Thats so sweet. (pause) Im gonna get some coffee. (gets up and
leaves)"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," (sliding into Joeys place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe)
Huh? Whatd ya say Joe? Ill be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Pheebs...
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," I just feel so, uhh....."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, All right!!
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, Im coming already!!
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Jeez!
0,season4,402cat,Monica," (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and
closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Hello, Chip."
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Hey, Rach! How ya doin?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at <i>Bloomingdales</i>,
have wonderful friends, and eventhough Im not seeing anyone right now, Ive
never felt better about myself."
0,season4,402cat,Chip," So ah, Monica ready yet?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage
compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
0,season4,402cat,Guy, What?!
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I
couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It
was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
0,season4,402cat,Guy," No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough."
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I cant,
Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
0,season4,402cat,Guy," All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)"
0,season4,402cat,Joey, Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! 
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Here, we are."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
0,season4,402cat,Chip, The what?
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Thats what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high
school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and youre Chip. Nevermind."
0,season4,402cat,Chip," No, I think its cute. (kisses her)"
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
0,season4,402cat,Chip, So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How
bout you?"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot.
Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire,
J.T., Breadsly."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Is that all?
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran
into Richard Dorfman."
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Ohh, how is he?"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Isnt he an architect now?
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Yeah, they still wear underwear."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, OH MY GOD!!!
0,season4,402cat,Joey, (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! 
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, Are you all right?!
0,season4,402cat,Joey, Yeah...
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, (lets him out) What happened?!!
0,season4,402cat,Joey," (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell
is all of our stuff?!!"
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt
think big enough to fit a grown man!"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, SoYou got in voluntarily?!
0,season4,402cat,Joey," I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy
again, do you know what Im gonna do?"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler, BEND OVER?!!!
0,season4,402cat,Chip," ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school
with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I
dont even know where you work?"
0,season4,402cat,Chip, You know where I work!
0,season4,402cat,Monica, I do?
0,season4,402cat,Chip," The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time."
0,season4,402cat,Monica, You still work at the multiplex?
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I
want. I can get you free posters for your room."
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?"
0,season4,402cat,Chip," Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo."
0,season4,402cat,Joey," (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!
Oh, no-no-no, here it is!"
0,season4,402cat,Monica, (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," (to Monica) So, how was your date?"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high
school?"
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Um-hmm.
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Oh honey, Im sorry."
0,season4,402cat,Monica," No, its okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I
got to dump Chip Matthews."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Ohh! Thats so great!
0,season4,402cat,Monica, I know!
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?"
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop
calling us."
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didnt tell her?! (They all kinda
shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all
over the place."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," Im sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)"
0,season4,402cat,Monica," Hey, we can take her back with you if you want."
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to
respect her decision. Right?"
0,season4,402cat,"Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel", Thats a good call. Right.
0,season4,402cat,Ross," No! No! LookHey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,
how many parents have you lost?"
0,season4,402cat,Ross, None.
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comes
back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if Im wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend. Okay? Be supportive."
0,season4,402cat,Ross, Im sorry.
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,402cat,Ross, I dont know what to say.
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, You could.... say youre sorry to her mom.
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, I think she would like that.
0,season4,402cat,Ross," (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.
Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends
mother."
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe, Thank you. We both forgive you.
0,season4,402cat,Rachel," So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me. And youre welcome to come back anytime."
0,season4,402cat,Chandler," Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate
it. (Joey nods in agreement)"
0,season4,402cat,Phoebe," Come on, Mom, Ill take you home."
0,season4,402cat,Rachel, Ill go with you.
0,season4,402cat,Monica, Me too. (they all leave)
0,season4,402cat,Ross," Oh! Y'know, Ive got an extra futon."
0,season4,402cat,Joey," Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Hey! New wallet, huh?"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just
doesnt say cool anymore."
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Rachel!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, What?
0,season4,404dance,Monica, You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door
and stops.)"
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Third door on the left.
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Right!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Ummm. Oh! Im sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)
Its a little old but"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, No.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, I didnt I never said that.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," (starting to cry) Okay, Im sorry. (Runs out still carrying the
pizza box.)"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," God! If youre gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to
through it out.]"
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. 
0,season4,404dance,Joey, Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just
forget about it."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed."
0,season4,404dance,Joey," All right thats it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the
door.)"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," (Picking up a card from Chandlers wallet.) My God! Is this a gym
card?"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive
missed the last 1200 times."
0,season4,404dance,Ross, So why dont you quit?
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria."
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Who is Maria?
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra
spandex covered gymtreat."
0,season4,404dance,Ross, You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, No!
0,season4,404dance,Ross, So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Oh no, youll have to come."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,
youre gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the
landlord."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey, I have actually not heard of that.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Why dont you tell me something I dont know! (He storms out,
and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an Oops! have.)"
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Oh please, somebody tell me I dont have to go to work today!"
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Whats the matter?
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every
time I see him I just want to do things to him that Im not allowed to charge for."
0,season4,404dance,Monica, So do them for free.
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling
around with clients. And its against my oath as a masseuse."
0,season4,404dance,Ross, They make you take an oath?
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and
umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just
makes good sense."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Why dont you just give him to somebody else?
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," No, I can handle it. No, Im a professional. (She starts to leave)"
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on
the table!"
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Youre gonna do some feet flirtin!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," I dont what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to
leaqve)"
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, Because its Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Oh! My hero! What happened?
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that hed better come up here and apologize. Ill see you later.
(Starts to leave)"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," What a minute, what did he say?"
0,season4,404dance,Joey," He said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedIll see
you later."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, What?! You got us evicted!!
0,season4,404dance,Monica, I told you not to go down there!
0,season4,404dance,Joey, Well he made Rachel cry!
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Rachel always cries!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Thats not true! (Starts to cry.)
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like
youve never sucked before!"
0,season4,404dance,Joey," All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler
and I until you get settled."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Go!!
0,season4,404dance,Joey," All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns
around) I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be
cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)"
0,season4,404dance,Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be
strong."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
0,season4,404dance,Ross," One more time, ""Hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock
hard pecs?"""
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Good! Thats good!
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee, You wanna quit?
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, I wanna quit the gym.
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee," You do realize that you wont have access to our new full
service Swedish spa."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong sound.) I
wanna quit the gym."
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee," Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. (Both
Chandler and Ross start to make their way to the membership office.) Uh, excuse me, (to
Ross) are you a member?"
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Me? No.
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee," Sorry, members only."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about
himself) I wanna quit the gym."
0,season4,404dance,Ross," Its okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)"
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee," (to Ross) So, are you a member of any gym."
0,season4,404dance,Ross," No! And Im not gonna be, so you can save you little speech."
0,season4,404dance,Gym Employee," Okay, no problem. (To someone out of the picture) Could you come
here for a second?"
0,season4,404dance,Woman," Hi, Im Maria."
0,season4,404dance,Rick," (looking at her feet) Wow, you have really pretty feet."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, These old things.
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, its been
killing me today."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
0,season4,404dance,Rick, Yeah.
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in
the siadic area can get yknow, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,
tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)"
0,season4,404dance,Rick, Ow! Did you just bite me?
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, No!
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Please dont kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasnt there
fault, it was mine."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," No you cant do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. Im the chick and Chandler is the
duck."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, Ill do whatever you want."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Yeah-yeah, absolutely."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," What, what is it?"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Thats not, prison lingo, is it?"
0,season4,404dance,Monica, His dancing partner?!
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Yeah, theres this superintendents dance, the Super Ball. I
dont know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that hes a crush on."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Well, why doesnt he practice with a girl?"
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Well, hes too shy, he doesnt thing hes good enough to
dance with girls yet."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down thatgarbage chute.
(Starts to cry)"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Hey.
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Hey! So, did you quit?"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter!"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Wait, now so you joined the gym?"
0,season4,404dance,Ross," And thats funny, why?"
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh,
thats it."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our
accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Well, you could actually go to the gym."
0,season4,404dance,Ross," Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at
the source."
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Youre a genius!
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Now, theres two reasons."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
0,season4,404dance,All, Hey!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Where?!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, On the touchy.
0,season4,404dance,Ross, And thats not against your oath?!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," No, I know! I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna
throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract
yourself."
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I
dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other
things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!"
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," Thank you, Joey."
0,season4,404dance,Joey," No-no, thank you."
0,season4,404dance,Joey," All right, Im here, lets ahh, get this over with."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Whoa-whoa, dont we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like
ahh, get really drunk?"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," No, its okay, but if Im Marge, my breasts are coming out my
back."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Come on man, youre not a potato."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Come on Treeger, dont say that. You just ahh, you just need more
practice. Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again. Come on. (they start
dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, yknow,

0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Monica," Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?"
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a
little dance step on the way.)"
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, (laughing) What was that?
0,season4,404dance,Joey, What?
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, You just did a little dancy thing.
0,season4,404dance,Joey, No I didnt.
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, You are soo enjoying this.
0,season4,404dance,Joey," No, Im not! And it wasnt a hop it was a pademarie. "
0,season4,404dance,Monica, (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
0,season4,404dance,Joey," All right, well maybe Im enjoying it a little bit. I mean Im
getting pretty good at it."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel," Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes."
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Hey-hey, hold on, this isnt some kind of like girly dance. All
right, its like a sport, its manly!"
0,season4,404dance,Monica," All right, then show me some manly moves."
0,season4,404dance,Joey, All right.
0,season4,404dance,Joey, I dont know how to lead.
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Hello.
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Hi.
0,season4,404dance,Ross, Wed like to close our accounts.
0,season4,404dance,Bank Officer, Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
0,season4,404dance,Ross, No-no.
0,season4,404dance,Chandler," No, wed just like to close them."
0,season4,404dance,Bank Officer," Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. (to a beautiful woman)
Would you come over here please?"
0,season4,404dance,Ms. Lambert," Hi, Im Karen."

0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," (thinking to herself) Chandlers knees. Chandlers
ankles. Chandlers ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, youre
all set."
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!"
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, Yeah! In really long hour world.
0,season4,404dance,Rick, What?
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because youre a
client, I cant ask you out, even though you give me yknow, the feeling."
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse. "
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, Really?!
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Yeah, really."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, What?
0,season4,404dance,Rick," Suddenly, I very aware that Im naked."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)"
0,season4,404dance,Mrs. Potter," Mr. Simons been waiting for(sees Phoebe and Rick) Oh my
God!"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Simon," Why wasnt I offered that? Id definitely pay more for
that."
0,season4,404dance,Mrs. Potter," Phoebe, we have rules here, this isnt that kind of place."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isnt what it looks like,
cause Rick is my ahh, husband."
0,season4,404dance,Mrs. Potter," Oh really? Well, then youd better tell his other wife,
cause she called three times asking where he is."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Yes, I will tell her."
0,season4,404dance,Monica, So you didnt leave the bank?
0,season4,404dance,Ross," No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account."
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, What are you ever gonna use that for?!
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, To pay for the gym.
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Hey.
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started
making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore."
0,season4,404dance,Joey, What?!
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, You got fired?! 
0,season4,404dance,Monica, Oh my Gosh!
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Its so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!"
0,season4,404dance,Rachel, Sweety...
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,
yknow? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these
policemen, thought I was a whore too. Its been a really bad day, whore wise."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Chandler, Yeah Bunny-rabbit.
0,season4,404dance,Joey," (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Look, you wanna use our place?"
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey, We did it!!
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," Oh well, okay, good luck."
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey, Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey, Okay.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey, Go get em Treeger.
0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,

0,season4,404dance,Mr. Treeger,
0,season4,404dance,Joey," No, Im good."
0,season4,404dance,Interviewer," So it looks like youve got some great experience here.
Lets see ahh, reason for leaving last job?"
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe," Yeah, they thought I was a whore."
0,season4,404dance,Interviewer," Okay, well give a call if anything comes up."
0,season4,404dance,Phoebe, Great! Thank you very much.
0,season4,405jng,Ross," (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that
girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a
really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore
him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores
him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely
Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face.
Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it
to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)"
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, Thank you.
0,season4,405jng,Gunther, Rachel?
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Yeah?

0,season4,405jng,Rachel," May fifth, why?"
0,season4,405jng,Gunther," Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Oh, mine's December..."
0,season4,405jng,Gunther," Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the
worst thing that could happen?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, I could die.
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to <em>Chucky Cheese</em>,
and you didn't even kiss her."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, (entering) Oh.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in
bed, and stay there."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all
I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,
and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Just be yourself. But, not too much."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
0,season4,405jng,Ross, (loudly) Good luck!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting
over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?"
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Uh Kathy, with K or a C?"
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, With a K.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Oh-oh-hey!
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Wow! You are really good at this.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm
waiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now."
0,season4,405jng,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)"
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how
I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
0,season4,405jng,Joey, Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze
in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.
(Starts to sing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you?</em> (Stops
singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly</em>--(stops singing)
Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Hi.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Jeez, at 2"
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted

0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," You're kidding! Oh, I love him."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've
known you guys were... I never would've..."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Oh please!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to
do; all of them had us making out."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse
with him."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, (laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Is it on?
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," No, but this wonder broom is amazing!"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Oh my God!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Oh! It's on! It's on!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, There we go little fella.
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, (laughs) What about the duck?
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Well the duck can swim.
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Oh, jeez. (Hits him)"
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (singing, drunk) <em>My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you
stick on me, ba-a-by!</em> Thanks for the lights honey. "
0,season4,405jng,All," Way to go, Phoebe!"
0,season4,405jng,Monica, That cold makes you sound so great.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)"
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters."
0,season4,405jng,All," Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Well, have fun!"
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Okay.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to
help sick hamsters."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Y'know what, I like Kathy."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Yeah, she's..."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she
said the funniest thing about--what? "
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, You love her.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," No, I don't."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Come on, Pheebs lay off him."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Thank you, Ross."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, All right.
0,season4,405jng,All, Ohh!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, All right.
0,season4,405jng,Monica," (turning around and doing that, ""I'm making out with someone,""
thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and
sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)"
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy
voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when
you were 14?"
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that
""Woo-hoo"" thing."
0,season4,405jng,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season4,405jng,Ross, (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Rachel's not here.
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Oh.
0,season4,405jng,Monica, How's it going with her?
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,
the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I
break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my
friends, and that's Ross."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Hi, Josh."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, Hi.
0,season4,405jng,Josh, Dudes.
0,season4,405jng,Monica," So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for
the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)"
0,season4,405jng,Josh," Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's
right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
0,season4,405jng,Josh," Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...
head."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a
passionate kiss.) I'll miss you."
0,season4,405jng,Josh, Dope! (exits)
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Wow, cute one!"
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Very!
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun
relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot
in a museum."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the
adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, What was that?
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Monica knows.
0,season4,405jng,Monica," It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our
parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I
cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was
actually cooler than my older brother."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date
tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her
voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to
sing) <em>My sticky shoes</em>--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!"
0,season4,405jng,Amanda, (opening the door) Hi!
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Hi!
0,season4,405jng,Amanda, Hi Ben!
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Wow! You-you look great!
0,season4,405jng,Amanda, Thanks!
0,season4,405jng,Ross, (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
0,season4,405jng,Amanda, I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
0,season4,405jng,Amanda," Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please
help yourself to anything in the fridge."
0,season4,405jng,Ross, What?
0,season4,405jng,Amanda," I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for
like a month."
0,season4,405jng,Ross, I-I-I...
0,season4,405jng,Amanda," (noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square,
but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh
uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)"
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Who wants to make some long distance calls?
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps
running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to <em>The Mod Squad</em> starts to
play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a
hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,
in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the
chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to
get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out
of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of
cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Pheebs, what are you doing?"
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be
easy, supposedly they're pretty common."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, What?!
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Are you serious?
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?
I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he
waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you
Chandler!"
0,season4,405jng,Monica," (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!"
0,season4,405jng,Joey, Hey.
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Really?!
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with
your head in the toilet."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, (laughs) Right in there!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that
the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the
concept one more time."
0,season4,405jng,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and
Kathy tonight?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
0,season4,405jng,Joey, It's 4
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me
straight through the week."
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Okay, I see what's going on here."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, You-you do?
0,season4,405jng,Joey, Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, You got me.
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I
made an <strong>effort</strong> to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an
effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Yeah. Right.
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But
that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Okay.
0,season4,405jng,Monica, (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!"
0,season4,405jng,Josh," So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna
marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!"
0,season4,405jng,Monica, What?
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, I think he's stealing from me.
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Why?
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Because he's stealing from me!
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he
looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Ughh! (Storms out after him)
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And
there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. "
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Thank you so much Phoebe.
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
0,season4,405jng,Monica, What are you doing with those?!
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Sorry, Phoebe."
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe, It's okay. How's the soup?
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Umm. (nodding her head, ""Good."")"
0,season4,405jng,Monica, Ohhhh!! Gross!!
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!"
0,season4,405jng,Joey, Is she great or what?
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy, Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet
stockings."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have
a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Uhh, no-no thanks."
0,season4,405jng,Kathy," Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)"
0,season4,405jng,Joey, (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, What?
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a
deal."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
0,season4,405jng,Joey," I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then
the least you can do is pretend."
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, I am pretending.
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Well then, do it better!"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler," Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking
about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm
so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every
minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her
first!!"
0,season4,405jng,Joey," Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
0,season4,405jng,Ross," (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one
of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,
I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
0,season4,405jng,Monica," No, sorry."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Well where's Amanda?
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go
up to your old room, and not make out."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," Ross, cough drops, please?"
0,season4,405jng,Ross, At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry
I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
0,season4,405jng,Ross, You see Amanda and I have a very special...
0,season4,405jng,Monica," (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her
baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad."
0,season4,405jng,Monica," And what are you laughing at, Miss
`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel," Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something
with it! (Shows her, her ring)"
0,season4,405jng,Monica," That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And
get me my cough drops!"
0,season4,405jng,Ross, Fine.
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Sorry.
0,season4,405jng,Ross," Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks
in my relationship."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Y'know...
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (singing) <em>Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.
Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats</em>. (to Gunther) Does it even work
without my sexy voice?"
0,season4,405jng,Gunther, I like it. (sneezes)
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," Gunther, kiss me."
0,season4,405jng,Gunther, What?
0,season4,405jng,Joey," (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board
over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually
gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
0,season4,405jng,Chandler, Can I sleep on your couch?
0,season4,405jng,Phoebe," (singing) <em>And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man</em>. Thank
you my babies."
0,season4,405jng,Gunther, Rachel?
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,405jng,Gunther," I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the
other day_"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, No!
0,season4,405jng,Gunther," Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't
stop it, and I've been feeling guilty."
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, (confused) Okay.
0,season4,405jng,Gunther," So umm, are we cool?"
0,season4,405jng,Rachel, (really confused) Okay.
0,season4,405jng,Gunther, I knew you'd understand.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy
naked! It was like torture!"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a
<strong>big</strong> surprise."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad
enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think
she knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like
energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen
her naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth!
Smooth! (leaves)"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe, Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
0,season4,407line,All, Yeah! Oh my God!
0,season4,407line,Casey, Here you go.
0,season4,407line,Joey," Great! All right, so Ill call you later."
0,season4,407line,Casey, Great! (leaves)
0,season4,407line,Chandler, (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
0,season4,407line,Joey, That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So
things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
0,season4,407line,Joey," No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, (shocked) What?
0,season4,407line,Joey," Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! (Laughs)"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
0,season4,407line,Joey, Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He cant believe he just
sad that.)"
0,season4,407line,Joey, What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you."
0,season4,407line,Joey, You got all that from the back of her head?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane."
0,season4,407line,Joey, Whos Elaine?
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," (singing) ""<em>Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.
Swinging with the greatest of ease</em>"" Darn it! Now, I dont know who to
get to the next verse."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Oh, you could just go uh, ""<em>greatest of ease</em> (plays air
guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about
bah-bah-bha-bhan?"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Well umm, yknow, I used to play."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college. I mean thats-thats when I really found my sound."
0,season4,407line,Monica," Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
0,season4,407line,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,407line,Monica," He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every
allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
0,season4,407line,Ross," Really? No. I mean, nah, I havent played in so long, and-and, well
its-its really personal stuff, yknow?"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Come on, play that funky music white boy."
0,season4,407line,Monica, Yeah!
0,season4,407line,Ross," No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up inNo, yeah,
okay. (Runs out.)"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Okay, guys."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," All right! Bring it on, you"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Here we go. (Plays one note) Yknow, Ive-Ive never played
my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its
about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Yknow, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. Thats what
Im"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
0,season4,407line,Monica," (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Really, bitchin!"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Wow, it was sowow!"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Really?! I mean, really?!!"
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Wow! Thanks, you guys. Thats uhohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you
another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. Ill be
right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, ImI am so
(starts to break up and leaves)"
0,season4,407line,Monica, Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Oh, I cant believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus
its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," You mean like, music?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Come in!
0,season4,407line,Kathy," (entering) Hey! (sees whats on TV) Oh God, is that <em>Baywatch</em>?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
0,season4,407line,Kathy, So is Joey around?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. So
uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
0,season4,407line,Kathy," I uh, dont really have a preference. You?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) of the
boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello."
0,season4,407line,Joey," (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I
were on our way back and had a little car trouble."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, What happened?
0,season4,407line,Joey," We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some
transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as
soon as I can."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Why cant you tell her?
0,season4,407line,Joey," Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about
to(he stops talking suddenly)"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Joey! Joey!!
0,season4,407line,Joey, Yeah?
0,season4,407line,Chandler, I thought your time ran out.
0,season4,407line,Joey," Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more(his time runs out for
real)"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he
says hes sorry."
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Oh.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," So I guess its just uh, you and me then."
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Oh, okay."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Yeah, I think it is!"
0,season4,407line,Kathy, So what did you do today?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut"
0,season4,407line,Kathy," (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, and then it got canceled.
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Well, I could cut it."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Really?! You do that?
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but
hey, what do you say?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy."
0,season4,407line,Kathy, You have really great hair.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through
his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yknow who also has
great hair is Joey!"
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Im basically done here. Just
let me get this off your neck."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, What-what cha doin?
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Checking to see if its even.
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Kay.
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Looks good.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phones making
sounds! (On phone) Hello!"
0,season4,407line,Joey," (on phone) Hey dude, its me."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Hey its Joey!
0,season4,407line,Joey," Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck
here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the
transmission wasnt there!"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, What?
0,season4,407line,Joey," Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit
a dog."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Okay.
0,season4,407line,Joey," Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
0,season4,407line,Kathy," (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no its fine, dont worry about
it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay. (listens) Yeah! Ill talk to
you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
0,season4,407line,Kathy, I forgot my purse.
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Oh. 
0,season4,407line,Kathy," No, I really did forget my purse."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad!"
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Horrible!
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
0,season4,407line,Kathy," No-no-no, the kiss was good."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Okay!
0,season4,407line,Kathy," No, but thats bad!"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened."
0,season4,407line,Kathy, What?!
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy
forever. Sound good?"
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Can you really do that?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him."
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see,
youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn. "
0,season4,407line,Kathy," Im sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, I-I think we have too.
0,season4,407line,Kathy, Okay. Bye.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against
the door.) Are you still out there?"
0,season4,407line,Kathy, (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)
0,season4,407line,Ross," (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays
the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time"
0,season4,407line,Monica," (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, theres a <em>Starbucks</em> about
three blocks down."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," (pushing Monica back onto the couch) Its so inspired! Look at him!
Look at him go!"
0,season4,407line,Ross, (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys
0,season4,407line,Monica," (to Phoebe) Hey, arent you up next?"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Oh no, Im not playing tonight."
0,season4,407line,Rachel, Why not?
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," I cant follow Ross! Itd be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed <em>The Beetles</em>. No."
0,season4,407line,Monica," Phoebe, Ross sucks! "
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Oh my God, hes not even appreciated in his own time. I would give
anything to not be appreciated in my own time!"
0,season4,407line,Monica," Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Yeah, Phoebe youre awful!"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe, You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
0,season4,407line,Joey," Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the
door.)"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to
reveal a fully furnished apartment.)"
0,season4,407line,Joey, (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
0,season4,407line,Chandler, I sure did.
0,season4,407line,Joey, Why?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice
for my friend."
0,season4,407line,Joey," Well, youre amazing."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh no-no-no. <strong>This</strong> is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)"
0,season4,407line,Joey," (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
0,season4,407line,Joey," Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh, I dont know."
0,season4,407line,Joey," Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey
listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im
gonna do that."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, You mean with Casey.
0,season4,407line,Joey," No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes
pretty cool."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Or Casey.
0,season4,407line,Joey," No-no, Kathy."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Could be Casey.
0,season4,407line,Joey," No. No, Kathy."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Consider Casey.
0,season4,407line,Joey," Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on
Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
0,season4,407line,Ross, (to Phoebe) Hey!
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
0,season4,407line,Ross," Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to
play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
0,season4,407line,Ross, Pheebs
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Yeah, I-I cantI mean yknow I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I justI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
I"
0,season4,407line,Ross," See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Yknow my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I
I wont play anymore."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Oh no. No-no-no, dont do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Yeah, okay."
0,season4,407line,Ross, Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
0,season4,407line,Monica, Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
0,season4,407line,Chandler, I kissed Kathy.
0,season4,407line,Ross, What?
0,season4,407line,Monica, Are you serious?
0,season4,407line,Phoebe, Does Joey know?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," No. Is there anyway, <strong>anyway</strong> you think hell
understand this?"
0,season4,407line,Monica," You obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all
look at her) Which we all appreciate."
0,season4,407line,Ross," No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is
it?"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," I think maybe, yeah."
0,season4,407line,Monica, He loves you.
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
0,season4,407line,Ross," Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Yeah! No, thats right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
0,season4,407line,Rachel," I know, I remember that!"
0,season4,407line,Monica, I remember you did.
0,season4,407line,Chandler, God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
0,season4,407line,Rachel, Because you do.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Yeah, I know."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,407line,Joey, Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Is that a real thing?
0,season4,407line,Joey," Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
0,season4,407line,Joey, Whats up?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot
actually."
0,season4,407line,Joey, You do?
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season4,407line,Joey," Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my
girlfriend anymore."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, What?
0,season4,407line,Joey," Yeah, she broke up with me."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh uh, when?"
0,season4,407line,Joey," Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, thats why I let people watch."
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
0,season4,407line,Joey," Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too."
0,season4,407line,Joey," No-no-no, no its uh, its okay."
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season4,407line,Joey, Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
0,season4,407line,Joey," But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out
for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into
some other guy. So"
0,season4,407line,Chandler," See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
0,season4,407line,Joey, Who?
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Its me. Im the other guy.
0,season4,407line,Joey, What?
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and"
0,season4,407line,Joey, And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
0,season4,407line,Chandler, No! No! No! I just kissed her.
0,season4,407line,Joey, What?!! Thats even worse!!
0,season4,407line,Chandler, How is that worse?!
0,season4,407line,Joey, I dont know! But its the same!
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think
Im in love with her!"
0,season4,407line,Joey, Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
0,season4,407line,Chandler," Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
0,season4,407line,Joey," Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that
you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
0,season4,407line,Joey," Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like
""Well, kinda."") Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
Im not gonna eat! You know why?!"
0,season4,407line,Chandler, Probably because
0,season4,407line,Joey," Because its all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And Im not happy about you either. (The bread maker
dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom
and slams the door.)"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it."
0,season4,407line,Monica, (removing ear plugs) What?
0,season4,407line,Rachel," Phoebe, his music could not <strong>get</strong> any worse. There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.
Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my
set?"
0,season4,407line,Phoebe," After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Yeah, like I could <strong>lose</strong> it."
0,season4,407line,Rachel, What?
0,season4,407line,Ross, I played bad on purpose guys.
0,season4,407line,Monica," Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
0,season4,407line,Ross," Yeahno, just that last song."
0,season4,408box,Joey, (answering phone) Hello.
0,season4,408box,Chandler," (on phone) Hey, its me. I know you cant stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone. All I
(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)"
0,season4,408box,Joey, (answering phone) Hello.
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im
(Joey hangs up the phone again.)"
0,season4,408box,Joey, (answering phone) Stop callin!!
0,season4,408box,Voice," (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge."
0,season4,408box,Joey, All right!
0,season4,408box,Voice," What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do
anything (Joey realizes its Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Look everyone, its the spirit of Thanksgiving!"
0,season4,408box,Rachel, So are things with you and Joey any better?
0,season4,408box,Chandler," They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?"
0,season4,408box,Ross," Should we <strong>all</strong> expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?"
0,season4,408box,Rachel, You shouldnt.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift. And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who."
0,season4,408box,Ross, Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I dont know why I do that.
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Well, Im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy."
0,season4,408box,Monica, We havent eaten yet!
0,season4,408box,Rachel," I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I
just (goes into her bedroom.)"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
cause I wanna trade for her."
0,season4,408box,Phoebe, I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like
impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it (notices the look on Monica and Phoebes faces.) Oh, there was no big
dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on
it (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe, Ohh.
0,season4,408box,Monica," Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller."
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase."
0,season4,408box,Monica, Who cares? He works in a museum!
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," You dont have to do that, Ross and Joey arent here, you can
watch the parade if you want."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Thanks.
0,season4,408box,Monica," What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," God, what happened?!"
0,season4,408box,Monica," Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
0,season4,408box,Rachel, (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Open it up, let me see."
0,season4,408box,Monica," Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Ooh, God it looks bad."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
0,season4,408box,Monica," No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont
have a boyfriend!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Hes really picky about his patients.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Honey, youve got to go. Whats his office number?"
0,season4,408box,Monica, Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," (on phone) Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellers
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) Hes out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
0,season4,408box,Monica, Yes!!
0,season4,408box,Phoebe, Yes! Shes very excited about that.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," This is so cool, til Monica gets back, its like Im
head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and
then decides to add it to the dish.)"
0,season4,408box,Ross," Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Okay, get out of my kitchen!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question."
0,season4,408box,Ross," So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch."
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," I dont know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your
office."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me."
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took
back."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Like?
0,season4,408box,Ross," Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, When was the last time you saw her wear it?
0,season4,408box,Ross," Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Big dog?
0,season4,408box,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,408box,Ross, What are you doing?
0,season4,408box,Joey, Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
0,season4,408box,Ross, Everything? Even the TV?
0,season4,408box,Joey, No! Im putting that in my room.
0,season4,408box,Ross," Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but dont you think you
could at least hear the guy out?"
0,season4,408box,Joey," Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?"
0,season4,408box,Ross," Thats a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Five years. 
0,season4,408box,Ross, Youve sentenced him?!
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hey! Dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
0,season4,408box,Ross," Joey, the guys your best friend."
0,season4,408box,Joey," No, <strong>was</strong> my best friend. Anyway, I dont know why
youre pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,
theres a spot open."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Oh, who? Me?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Yeah!
0,season4,408box,Ross," Wow! Im honored! And yknow what Im gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, What?
0,season4,408box,Ross, Im gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
0,season4,408box,Joey, All right. But if you werent my best friend.
0,season4,408box,Chandler," I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian. And I<strong> know</strong> he only knows the bad words."
0,season4,408box,Joey," (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Hey Joe.
0,season4,408box,Joey, (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
0,season4,408box,Doctor," Ill be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy."
0,season4,408box,Monica, Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Ooh, so cute, that Im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
0,season4,408box,Nurse, Dr. Burke will see you know.
0,season4,408box,Monica," Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now."
0,season4,408box,Nurse," Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now."
0,season4,408box,Dr. Timothy Burke, Ready?
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Hey! Im sorry! That(sees that Joey is about to leave)
where are you going?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, My folks.
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
0,season4,408box,Joey," I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, What?!
0,season4,408box,Joey," Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
Ill stop seeing her?"
0,season4,408box,Joey," Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt
know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler
grabs his bag and stops him.)"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.
0,season4,408box,Chandler," All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a <strong>very</strong> difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!"
0,season4,408box,Joey," When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! "
0,season4,408box,Chandler, What?
0,season4,408box,Joey," Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Weve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
0,season4,408box,Tim," Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were
just standing outside <em>The Dairy Queen</em>."
0,season4,408box,Monica, I was probably waiting for it to open.
0,season4,408box,Tim," I gotta tell you, you look great now."
0,season4,408box,Monica, You look great too.
0,season4,408box,Tim, Youre an excellent patient!
0,season4,408box,Monica, So how does it look?
0,season4,408box,Tim," Well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to
wear a patch for a couple of days."
0,season4,408box,Monica, Like a pirate?!
0,season4,408box,Tim, If that helps you. 
0,season4,408box,Monica," Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him."
0,season4,408box,Tim, I moved back here a couple of months ago.
0,season4,408box,Monica, Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
0,season4,408box,Tim, Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)
0,season4,408box,Monica, No way!
0,season4,408box,Tim, I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriends.
0,season4,408box,Monica, (disappointed) Oh.
0,season4,408box,Tim, But we broke up.
0,season4,408box,Monica, (happy) Oh. 
0,season4,408box,Tim, She-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment.
0,season4,408box,Monica," (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirates voice) So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?"
0,season4,408box,Tim, Youre not wearing the patch yet.
0,season4,408box,Monica, I know.
0,season4,408box,Ross, Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
0,season4,408box,Rachel," I know, its sick."
0,season4,408box,Monica, Why is it sick?
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Because its Richards son! Its like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!"
0,season4,408box,Monica," Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand dont you?"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Yeah, I can see where Id be your best shot but, no. Im
sorry, but I think its twisted."
0,season4,408box,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,408box,Joey, (coming out of the bathroom) Whats twisted?
0,season4,408box,Monica, Me going out with Richards son.
0,season4,408box,Joey, Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
0,season4,408box,Chandler," (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me."
0,season4,408box,Rachel, Is he okay in there?
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hes fine!
0,season4,408box,Ross," Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richards son,
youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
0,season4,408box,Monica," Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,
(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice
dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girls wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)
livin in a box!! (goes to her room)"
0,season4,408box,Rachel," So now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Chandler?
0,season4,408box,Chandler," The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!"
0,season4,408box,Ross," (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?"
0,season4,408box,Rachel, (worried) Why?
0,season4,408box,Ross, I just wanna check something.
0,season4,408box,Rachel, Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
0,season4,408box,Ross," (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, well
see."
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
0,season4,408box,Rachel," (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time."
0,season4,408box,Ross," (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. "
0,season4,408box,Ross, Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Well isnt it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?"
0,season4,408box,Ross, What did you get?
0,season4,408box,Rachel, Credit. 
0,season4,408box,Monica," (running in from her bedroom) Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim."
0,season4,408box,Tim, Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)
0,season4,408box,Monica," Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. "
0,season4,408box,Tim," Hi, nice to meet you."
0,season4,408box,Monica, And Joey.
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,408box,Tim," Hi, Joey."
0,season4,408box,Monica," My brother, Ross."
0,season4,408box,Ross, Hey.
0,season4,408box,Monica, And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And thats Chandler.
0,season4,408box,Chandler, How do ya do.
0,season4,408box,Tim, Whats
0,season4,408box,Monica," Umm, well, hes"
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hes doin some thinkin!
0,season4,408box,Chandler, What happened? What happened?!
0,season4,408box,Joey, You kissed my girlfriend!
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Ooh, I like those sunglasses."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Like em, like em? Or, Id like to get store credit for
that amount like em?"
0,season4,408box,Rachel," (Swears in Italian, its the same term used by Joey earlier and
Joey nods his approval.)"
0,season4,408box,Monica," All right everybody, this turkey is ready!"
0,season4,408box,Tim, Where can I wash up?
0,season4,408box,Monica," Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap."
0,season4,408box,Tim, Thank you.
0,season4,408box,Rachel, Fancy soap? I thought we were savin that for the Pope!
0,season4,408box,Monica, See hes nice. Right?
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, ""Thats not how your dad used to do it."""
0,season4,408box,Tim, Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
0,season4,408box,Monica, I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
0,season4,408box,Rachel, (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Oh, Ill get it. (goes over to the door.)"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Gotcha! (laughs)
0,season4,408box,Joey, That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Sorry!
0,season4,408box,Joey," Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I
think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Okay, okay, you got it!"
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Ross, can you pass me the yams?"
0,season4,408box,Ross," Sure! Oh, and Joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them."
0,season4,408box,Rachel, Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
0,season4,408box,Monica," Oh-ho-ho, weve got company."
0,season4,408box,Ross," Theres nothing the matter with me. See, Im not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!"
0,season4,408box,Joey," All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight."
0,season4,408box,Joey, So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Absolutely!
0,season4,408box,Joey," That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
(Theres no response from Chandler.) Okay."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Dont say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross
whats in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the
museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter! "
0,season4,408box,Ross," I dont know what to say, Im sorry. Though, youre not
supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) Its like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that."
0,season4,408box,Monica," (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)"
0,season4,408box,Tim," Here, let me help. (Does so.)"
0,season4,408box,Monica, Thank you.
0,season4,408box,Tim, You-you have a very beautiful eye.
0,season4,408box,Monica, Yknow all my friends think this is weird. 
0,season4,408box,Tim," Yknow I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and
canceled, but it really isnt."
0,season4,408box,Monica," I know! I mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally
separate thing."
0,season4,408box,Tim," Oh, I totally agree."
0,season4,408box,Monica, Were just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
0,season4,408box,Tim, What?
0,season4,408box,Monica, Nothing. Nothing.
0,season4,408box,Tim," No-no really, was-was that not okay?"
0,season4,408box,Monica," No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss"
0,season4,408box,Tim, Oh my God! It didnt remind you of
0,season4,408box,Monica, (interrupting) Dont say it!
0,season4,408box,Tim," No, but it did! Didnt it?!"
0,season4,408box,Monica, Yeah!
0,season4,408box,Tim, Oh man!!
0,season4,408box,Monica, I know!
0,season4,408box,Joey, Ill get it. (Its Kathy.)
0,season4,408box,Joey, Hey.
0,season4,408box,Joey, Thats okay. Chandlers the one Im mad at.
0,season4,408box,Joey, In the box.
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Oh, he-he cant talk right now."
0,season4,408box,Phoebe, Hes just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Joey, had reasons. "
0,season4,408box,Phoebe, They were threefold.
0,season4,408box,Joey, (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
0,season4,408box,Rachel, What?!
0,season4,408box,Joey," He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, So?
0,season4,408box,Joey," Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out!"
0,season4,408box,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season4,408box,Joey," Yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there."
0,season4,408box,Chandler," Man, this is "
0,season4,408box,Joey," Now go! Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from
youre secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) "
0,season4,408box,Joey," All right, who got Chandler? Cause I uh, need to trade."
0,season4,408box,Rachel," Oh, he sees her!"
0,season4,408box,Monica," Oh, hes catching up to her!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Oh, she sees him! Oh, theyre hugging!"
0,season4,408box,Ross, Hes taking her purse!
0,season4,408box,Joey," Uhh, thats not them. Im gonna go call the police."
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," Oh, there they are!"
0,season4,408box,Phoebe," All right, get a room."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Okay!
0,season4,409party,Monica," Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands
over their eyes.)"
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very
good."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Okayyyyy, open up! "
0,season4,409party,Ross," What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this <strong>bitchin'</strong>
van!"
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Yeah, its for our catering business!"
0,season4,409party,Joey, I think I know that girl.
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right, umm, were not gonna really keep it this way though."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, No?
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," No, were gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a
baguette. "
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Oh!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," And also, we dont know what to do with this. (She turns on a
switch and the girls nipples light up.)"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
0,season4,409party,Monica," (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that
put cilantro with everything?"
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Oh sure, Cilantro Larry."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Well, Im gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea
Reporter."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of
people."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
0,season4,409party,Monica," Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all
of you out for a <strong>lot</strong> of free dinners."
0,season4,409party,All, Yay!!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Oh, in that case(hops up and down in joy)Yay! (Monica looks
confused) That was me hopping on board."
0,season4,409party,Monica, Oh.
0,season4,409party,Chandler," (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you
ready to party?"
0,season4,409party,Ross," I dont know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but
theres this thing about bumblebees on <em>The Discovery Channel</em> that I was
planning to watch."
0,season4,409party,Chandler," No-no, I dont think you heard me. Are you ready to <strong>party</strong>?!"
0,season4,409party,Ross, Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we
are partying with Gandolf dude!"
0,season4,409party,Ross," Dude, we are<strong> sooo</strong> gonna party!"
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?"
0,season4,409party,Ross," Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world."
0,season4,409party,Chandler, Im gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
0,season4,409party,Ross, Im gonna call after you!
0,season4,409party,Chandler," This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!"
0,season4,409party,Chandler and Ross, Woooo!!!
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with
me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
0,season4,409party,Ross," Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
0,season4,409party,Ross," Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didnt you read <em>Lord
of the Rings</em> in high school?"
0,season4,409party,Joey," No, I had sex in high school."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.
Theres an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people
all day and"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you cant stay my assistant
forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," God, I am so glad you dont have a problem with this, because if
you did, I wouldnt even <strong>consider</strong> applying."
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Really? Well, in that case"
0,season4,409party,Rachel," (interrupting) And thats Im so glad theres no
problem."
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so
therell be at least one friendly face."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Ohh! Thats great!
0,season4,409party,Joanna," You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the <strong>ugliest</strong>
guy to get that job."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Really?!
0,season4,409party,Joanna," No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you
worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy
to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Well, I, umm"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Kidding! God, I feel wild today!"
0,season4,409party,Chandler, Oh man! I am so excitedI may vomit!
0,season4,409party,Joey," Will you calm down, hes just a human guy."
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Look you dont understand, Gandolf is amazing. Yknow
youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of
beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! "
0,season4,409party,Joey, Really?!
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Oh yeah, its beautiful country up there."
0,season4,409party,Ross," (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite
kit!"
0,season4,409party,Chandler, Its not gonna be <strong>exactly</strong> like last time.
0,season4,409party,Joey," All right, Ill see you guys."
0,season4,409party,Chandler and Ross, Whoa-whoa-whoa!
0,season4,409party,Chandler, Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
0,season4,409party,Joey," I have an audition, but Ill definitely hook up with you later. Where
are you gonna be around noon?"
0,season4,409party,Ross, Somewhere maybe along the equator?
0,season4,409party,Joey, Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
0,season4,409party,Chandler," (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) Its Gandolf!!! (on
phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
(Hangs up)"
0,season4,409party,Ross, What happened?
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago."
0,season4,409party,Ross," Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
0,season4,409party,Mr. Posner," You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what
I see here about implementing a new filing system."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put
on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the
filing cabinets. "
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch," I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather
important responsibilities."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel
for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost <strong>every</strong> time!"
0,season4,409party,Rachel," I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Oh yes, well theres the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can
carry two things at once!"
0,season4,409party,Mr. Posner," Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is
cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Yes, I realize that"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," (interrupting) And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The
only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, I love working with designers!
0,season4,409party,Joanna," With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?"
0,season4,409party,Monica, Hey! My first review is out!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm."
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right, look at my on the back page."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Oh, okay! (reading) ""Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure,
but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to
my head."" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for
catering."
0,season4,409party,Monica, Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," No-no, its okay. But are we sure we dont want the waterbed?"
0,season4,409party,Monica, Havent we made this decision?
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)"
0,season4,409party,Monica, Bye!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Bye!
0,season4,409party,Monica, (answering it) Who is it?
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," Its Allesandro, from Allesandros."
0,season4,409party,Monica, Oh my God.
0,season4,409party,Allesandro, I want to talk to you about your review.
0,season4,409party,Monica," Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!"
0,season4,409party,Allesandro, Why? So you could hang up on me?
0,season4,409party,Monica," Look, I-Im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
0,season4,409party,Allesandro, Just give me a chance too
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go."
0,season4,409party,Monica, No! Phoebe!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Hey, Monica!"
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is <strong>not</strong>
inedible swill!"
0,season4,409party,Monica," I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, and
one of them eats books."
0,season4,409party,Allesandro, Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
0,season4,409party,Monica, The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," Well, you said that we except the <em>Discover Card</em>, which we
do not!"
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know food
and that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should
serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. "
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes
good?! Where are you even from?"
0,season4,409party,Allesandro, (shyly) Lebanon.
0,season4,409party,Monica," Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste
like! Come on, hand me them."
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go
yell at."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," (entering Joannas office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that
interview."
0,season4,409party,Joanna, I thought it went very well.
0,season4,409party,Rachel," No! It didnt! Thats what I want to talk to you about.
(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are
not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you."
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Rachel, please, dont make a scene."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Theres nobody here!
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now youre making
Sophie uncomfortable!"
0,season4,409party,Sophie, Shes not making me uncomfortable.
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless.
Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)"
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Do you want me to quit?
0,season4,409party,Joanna, What?! What would make you think that?
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you
believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Yknow what? <strong>I</strong>
am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,
which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes
she has nothing.) Well, I guess theres no use to me sticking around til the
end of the day! (Starts to leave.)"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in
its drawer. If you must know the truth, I didnt want to lose a perfectly good
assistant."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, What?
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Thats why I said all those things about your flirting and your
drinking"
0,season4,409party,Rachel, My drinking? 
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Oh, I mustve said that after you left."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Said what? Exactly.
0,season4,409party,Joanna, That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible
person!"
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If youre gonna get all
sensitive about it! I dont want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you?
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Say more things like that.
0,season4,409party,Joanna," You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow."
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Id need an expense account.
0,season4,409party,Joanna, Done!
0,season4,409party,Rachel, And an assistant.
0,season4,409party,Joanna," Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youd be out partying
with Gandel-worf."
0,season4,409party,Ross," Its Gandolf, and hes not coming."
0,season4,409party,Joey, So youve been sittin around here all mornin?
0,season4,409party,Ross, No! I balanced my checkbook. 
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
0,season4,409party,Ross, I cant believe he didnt come!
0,season4,409party,Joey, So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be <strong>out</strong> all
night!"
0,season4,409party,Ross," Yeah! Wed meet, wed meet total strangers, and hang out with
them!"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Well, we could do that! "
0,season4,409party,Ross, Theres other stuff too.
0,season4,409party,Joey," Well do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want
to party with us, dude! Come on!"
0,season4,409party,Ross, Yeah!
0,season4,409party,Joey, Yeah!
0,season4,409party,Ross, Yeah!!
0,season4,409party,Joey, Yeah!! 
0,season4,409party,Ross, Its not like we dont know how to party!!
0,season4,409party,Joey, Yeah! All right? Lets go!
0,season4,409party,Chandler, And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
0,season4,409party,Joey and Ross, Yeah!!!
0,season4,409party,Chandler, All right!!
0,season4,409party,Ross," (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?"
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were
licking your face?"
0,season4,409party,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Well, those were seals, man."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on
an assistant buyer?"
0,season4,409party,Monica," Okay, the owner of Allesandros came over to yell at me, but
instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!"
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way
home, but Im soo happy!"
0,season4,409party,Monica, Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Ohh, youve waited soo long. "
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season4,409party,Rachel, How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at <em>Bloomingdales</em>?
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," I dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and
(realizes) You got the job!!"
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Yes!!!
0,season4,409party,Monica, You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Ohh, its gonna be so great! Im gonna get to help decide what
we sell, Im gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)
Im gonna have walls!"
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding
reception."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel
excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from
catering."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, But weve only had one job.
0,season4,409party,Monica," I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like
its snowballing, yknow?"
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Yeah! What are you saying?
0,season4,409party,Monica, I got offered the head chef job at Allesandros.
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, What?
0,season4,409party,Monica," Its okay, cause y'know what? You dont really need me
for the business."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Youre the cook! With out you its just me driving up to
peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!"
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right. But umm, I-I-Ill pay you back all the money you
invested, <strong>and</strong> you can keep the van."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, For what? I cant believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) 
0,season4,409party,Monica," Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)"
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Im an assistant buyer!!
0,season4,409party,Joey," All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and
well head back out."
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Yeah, all right."
0,season4,409party,Ross, Okay.
0,season4,409party,Joey," So, were having fun, right?"
0,season4,409party,Chandler and Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,409party,Joey," We dont need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to
some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that
boat thing."
0,season4,409party,Ross, Im kinda beat.
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Actually, me too."
0,season4,409party,Joey, Are you serious?!
0,season4,409party,Chandler and Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,409party,Joey, Thank God! Im exhausted!
0,season4,409party,Gunther, So you guys want coffees?
0,season4,409party,Joey," Yeah, but uh, I dont want to be up too late, so uh, Ill have a
decaf. "
0,season4,409party,Ross," Yeah, me too."
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I
strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
0,season4,409party,Joey," I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
0,season4,409party,Ross," Im just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? I used
them as mittens, I didnt want to touch a <strong>thing</strong> in that last place."
0,season4,409party,Ross, How sad are we?
0,season4,409party,Joey," Yeah, I know."
0,season4,409party,Chandler," Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were
just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
0,season4,409party,Joey and Ross, Yeah!
0,season4,409party,Joey," Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my
friends."
0,season4,409party,Chandler and Ross, Yeah!
0,season4,409party,Ross," And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
0,season4,409party,Joey," Were 29, were not women."
0,season4,409party,Monica," (entering) Ohh, here you are. Yknow, Im-Im glad you
decided to hear me out."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Okay, Im hearing."
0,season4,409party,Monica," Ive been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up
with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower
delivery person."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, What?!
0,season4,409party,Monica, Or! A bakery delivery person.
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, I wa-I wa-I wa
0,season4,409party,Monica, Pizza?!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Monica! 
0,season4,409party,Monica," All right, Ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but
umm, Im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, No.
0,season4,409party,Monica," Okay. Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you
probably dont want to pick stuff up either."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, No.
0,season4,409party,Monica," Yknow what, lets do the catering business."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe, Really?! Are you sure?
0,season4,409party,Monica," Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Yknow what, itd
be, itd be fun."
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Oh! It <strong>will</strong> be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, lets
plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and
starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)
Wow! You <strong>really</strong> wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)
Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job."
0,season4,409party,Monica, Really?!
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Yeah. Thats what you really want. Yeah, I dont want to be
the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I <strong>really</strong>
dont want to be the reason Im unhappy."
0,season4,409party,Monica, Thank you.
0,season4,409party,Phoebe," Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?"
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch, Oh my goodness! You havent heard!
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Heard what?
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch, Joanna passed away last night.
0,season4,409party,Rachel, Oh my God! How?!
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch," Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!"
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch, I know!
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God."
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch, I didnt realize that she was so close.
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Yes, <strong>so</strong> close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an
emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any
paperwork your way before it happened."
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch," No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few
seconds later."
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing
about an assistant buyer?"
0,season4,409party,Mrs. Lynch," (starting to cry) No, Im sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as
Sophie arrives.)"
0,season4,409party,Sophie, (happily) Good morning!
0,season4,409party,Rachel," Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnt hear about Joanna"
0,season4,409party,Sophie, I sure did! (smiles)
0,season4,409party,Allesandro," Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us.
Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of
the family. Of course, that <strong>literally</strong> is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. Now, I
know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review.
So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef."
0,season4,409party,Monica,"  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a
pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the
recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?"
0,season4,410girl,Ross, Hey! 
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Joey stuffing 15 <em>Oreos</em> in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious
mouth full, nods yes.)"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an <em>Oreo</em> and
Joey mumbles, no!)"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, Where were you?
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Oh, which museum?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," (just Phoebe) No, answer his."
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the
door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my
mercy."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
0,season4,410girl,Ross," No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She
seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours
away."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they
all look at him) That joke wouldve killed in Albany."
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie
remains all over his teeth.)"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) Theyre lighting the big
Christmas tree tonight."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Umm, that papers two weeks old. "
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really
wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I <strong>hate</strong>
being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day,
then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree
again. Ohh, I <strong>want</strong> somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)
Yknow, I want a <strong>man</strong>!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it
doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be
great."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling.
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Well, believe me, its been a long time since Ive been flung."
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Well, I know what Im giving you for Christmas."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Yknow what? Theres some nice guys at my office, do you
want me to set you up?"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive been
single. How come you never offered this before?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy. So, I no longer
feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont like
guys with boring jobs."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
0,season4,410girl,All, Hey!
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, Whats wrong Mon?
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season4,410girl,Monica," I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I
get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chefs
hat. (The hat says Quit, bitch)"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Hey, honey! Whats the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I
was just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
0,season4,410girl,Monica," I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and
Monica glares at him.)"
0,season4,410girl,Joey, Ohhh!
0,season4,410girl,Monica," I mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something Ive been waiting for
my whole life."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Well, wait a minute, youre the boss! Why dont you just yell
at them? Or, fire them?"
0,season4,410girl,Monica," I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know
that Im not good at confrontation."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,
I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so
he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss."
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?"
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Thats a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
0,season4,410girl,Joey, Good enough to get fired.
0,season4,410girl,Monica," All right, youre hired!"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct <em>Burger King</em> commercials?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im
not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!"
0,season4,410girl,Drew, I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
0,season4,410girl,Drew," Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any
thing serious."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a
fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
0,season4,410girl,Mike," Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas
party, Rachel?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
0,season4,410girl,Mike, Oh wow! Im free for her!
0,season4,410girl,Drew," Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!"
0,season4,410girl,Mike," Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game
tomorrow?"
0,season4,410girl,Drew," Hold on, yknow I <strong>just</strong> got a box of Cubans, maybe I
bring them by your office around uh, five?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to
stay, but sure!"
0,season4,410girl,Mike," Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch
Basel Hadens."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Well, I dont really know what that is, but <strong>lets</strong>!!"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Hey! You guys, Im writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want
to hear it?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," (singing) <em>Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!</em>"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Pheebs, thats great!"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Oh, yay!"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
0,season4,410girl,Joey," What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.
Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a
nickname thats easier to rhyme?"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Oh yeah!
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," (entering) Hello, children!"
0,season4,410girl,All, Hey!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Really?!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing
themselves at me! Theyre buying me drinks! Theyre giving me stuff! (to Joey)
Knicks tonight?"
0,season4,410girl,Joey, Sure! Where are the seats?
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Wherever! Ive got like 20!
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," So, will I like any of these guys?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Yknow what, Im gonna uh, play the field just a little
more."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Chandler!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me?
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, (shocked) You work with robots!!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, theres this one guy, Patrick, I
think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a
swimmer."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Op, I like credit cards!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Well, so what does he do?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Your company has a fine foods division?
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Its a big company, I dontif youI"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Now, wait a second! You make food <strong>and</strong> robots?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," No! No, the robots just work for them."
0,season4,410girl,Monica," (getting up) All right, Im gonna go to work. Does anybody have a
problem with that?"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, You want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Oh, what are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?"
0,season4,410girl,Monica," You bet your ass, Im gonna fire you! Thank you. "
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Oh yeah! With who?
0,season4,410girl,Ross, You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide
between the two of them. Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a
two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this
other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Yknow shes, well
shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes <strong>not</strong>
fun."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? She lives so
close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that
wasif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding,
shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist."
0,season4,410girl,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,410girl,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Hey, man!"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
0,season4,410girl,Joey, (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
0,season4,410girl,Joey, (entering from the dining room) Hey.
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Hey.
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket? (sees theres a
burn spot on it)"
0,season4,410girl,Monica," They baked it. I cant take this anymore. Im gonna call a
meeting tonight, Im gonna fire you tonight."
0,season4,410girl,Joey," You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens
to be over her breast.)"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, What are you doing?!
0,season4,410girl,Joey, Its still a tiny bit on fire there.
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Thanks. (Joeys still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Well, like father, like son."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I
thought you were looking for some kind of a fling."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnt tell him that, though?
Right?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Ummmmmmmm, no."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell
the guy that!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just
looking to getoh I see."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting
out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea."
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. Since
I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work
nickname."
0,season4,410girl,A Waiter," (entering) Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
(hands him two envelopes)"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," (opening an envelope) Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in
this one!"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter," Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never
hurts to wear tight trousers."
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is
nobody writing these down?"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter, Because we can remember them.
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter," Well, sure, that too."
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right heres the
thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive
atmosphere"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter, Cant hear you!
0,season4,410girl,Monica," (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She
holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be <strong>my</strong>
way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at
the money hes holding, and doesnt speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?!"
0,season4,410girl,Joey, No maam.
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter," Hey! He has a name, its Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?
Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, What the hell happened?!
0,season4,410girl,Joey," I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there
with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,
""Wow! Its been a long time since I had (tries to do the math in his head,
but cant) 327 + 238 dollars!"""
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Joey, we had a deal. That-thats why youre here! Ive
got to fire you!"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice
things Ive been saying about you."
0,season4,410girl,Monica, What kinda things have you been saying?
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," (interrupting) Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs?"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, What?
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Im not Jewish, so"
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," So! Ross doesnt <strong>really</strong> decorate his tree with
floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which
wakes up Ross with a start.)"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Bad dream?
0,season4,410girl,Ross, I wasnt sleeping.
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," The one with the cat. I gotta go, Ive got another date."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," So, did you pick one yet?"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a
different joke than I thoughtit wasnt that funny. So Im still torn."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and
youre too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end
them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your
way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, youre
done!"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Yknow, youre right. Thank you."
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Prague?
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe, Theres sooo much you dont know.
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, I did! I absolutely did!
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, You idiot!!
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Im sure youre right, but why?"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious
relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Yknow, you should <strong>never</strong> be allowed to talk to
people!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, I know! I know!
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being
alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody!
Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I
didnt have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Really?
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, No.
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Oh, it doesnt matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,
yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come
with me?"
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
0,season4,410girl,Chandler," Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians
with no teeth."
0,season4,410girl,Rachel, Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, Have you ever been with a woman?
0,season4,410girl,Rachel," What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!"
0,season4,410girl,Chandler, So there is no good time to ask that question.
0,season4,410girl,The Conductor, The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
0,season4,410girl,Monica," I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me
some more swordfish?"
0,season4,410girl,Kitchen Worker, I dont speak English.
0,season4,410girl,Monica, You did a minute ago!
0,season4,410girl,Kitchen Worker," Well, I dont know what to tell ya!"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Fine!
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, Im cold!
(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door
opens)"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter," You found that handle, did ya?"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Thats not funny.
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter, Well thats not true.
0,season4,410girl,Monica," (starting to cry) Im a good person. And Im a good chef, and
I dont deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Yknow what, if you want me
to quit this bad, then all you have to do is"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Yknow that little speech you made
the other day? Well I got a problem with it!"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, You do?
0,season4,410girl,Joey," You bet I do! I just ah, wasnt listening then, thats all."
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Well if you want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
0,season4,410girl,Joey, What are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
0,season4,410girl,Monica," You bet your ass Im gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get
out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How bout you Chuckles?
You think this is funny now?"
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter, No.
0,season4,410girl,Monica," How about if I <strong>dance around</strong> all covered in sauce? Huh?
You think its funny now? "
0,season4,410girl,The Waiter," No, its really good."
0,season4,410girl,Monica," Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from
earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!"
0,season4,410girl,The Conductor," Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
0,season4,410girl,Ross," (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting
next to him)"
0,season4,410girl,Woman On Train," I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that
I see them, I win."
0,season4,410girl,Ross, What?
0,season4,410girl,Woman On Train, Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
0,season4,410girl,Ross, (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
0,season4,410girl,Woman On Train," Yes we are. So, coffee?"
0,season4,410girl,Ross," Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
0,season4,410girl,Woman On Train," Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
"
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I
talked back to chef Geller!"
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Thanks.
0,season4,410girl,Joey," Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon
house this year."
0,season4,410girl,Monica, Enough!
0,season4,410girl,Joey, (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
0,season4,410girl,Phoebe," (singing) ""<em>Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.<br/>
                               
Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.<br/>
                               
Said all you need is to write them a song.<br/>
                               
They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.<br/>
                               
No, don't sing along.</em>"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Oh my God! I cant believe my little brother is married!
0,season4,411towpu,Frank, Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," You guys, why didnt you tell me you were eloping?"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Cause it just sorta happened, yknow we were at the
courthouse, we were having lunch"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? "
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
""Hey! Y'know, were here, having lunch lets get married!"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Wow, a year and a half ago I didnt even know I had a brother, and
now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.
Stop it, dont. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Uhh, yeah."
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," Weve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got
engaged, we thought wed get a jump on things, yknow no ones getting any
younger."
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," See the thing is umm, were not able to yknow, uh, conceive."
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," And weve tried everything, weve seen a bunch of doctors."
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby
is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into
another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," (shocked) Thats a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy
boat."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Hes
wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross, What?
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Well, you-you know what I meant."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," No, you messed it up. Youre stupid."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, So what job did you get Joe?
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur
expert or something?"
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, its
like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) ""And on your left, you have
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Uh actually Joey, its the Cretasous period."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!!
0,season4,411towpu,All, Hey!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!"
0,season4,411towpu,All, Oh my God!!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," And! And, theyre gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!
And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross, My God!
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Are you serious?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Yeah
0,season4,411towpu,Joey, Youre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Ewww! And ""Oh no!"" Itsthey just want me to be the
surrogate. Its her-its her egg and her sperm, and Im-Im just the
oven, its totally their bun. "
0,season4,411towpu,Joey, Huh.
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, What did you tell them?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to
think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a <em>Sony Play
Station</em>?"
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, I know!
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else!"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Yeah, whats your point?"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Well, the stuff I just mentioned."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Wow! I dont know if I could ever do that. I always figured the
first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive
like crazy."
0,season4,411towpu,All, Yeah.
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, We just want you to think it through.
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like
your mom?"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
0,season4,411towpu,Kathy," Umm, (moves her hands down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I
take it to work with me?"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants."
0,season4,411towpu,Kathy, Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, I am so jealous.
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, You guys are really rightthere arent you?
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Yes. Right where?
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex
and talking and"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, And the sex?
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big
deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the
next level."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Oh, Chandler that is so nice."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross, That is really nicelying! No way is that the reason!
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something
like that?!"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," No, hes right, Im totally lying."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Then what is it?
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross, And youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt
mean hes great in bed."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes
to agree with him a lot."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be
great, cause you-you guys are in love."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season4,411towpu,Ross, Just go for it Chandler.
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Yeah, you should."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Yeah, you should, really."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Go on.
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But
Im just doing it for you guys."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
0,season4,411towpu,Smart Kid, Isnt the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a
fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display
cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave
Hi to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at
work. (Ross does the old ""Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your
mouth trick."") Okay, moving right along. Come on."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr, Its open! Come in!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr, Hi!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Im sorry, Im late."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Oh, thats okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Wow! You really go all out when youre expecting company.
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," No, I was working on my pottery."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didnt know that you didpot."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and
erotica."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Ooh, erotiery!"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just
thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.
Yknow"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," I really dont think its a very good idea, Phoebe."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Why not?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Well, because youd be giving up a baby, and I-I really
dontI dont know if theres anything I can say that could make you
understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the
couch.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Dont-dont hurt the
puppy."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," No-no-no, the-the puppys yours."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Oh, I get a puppy!!"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Why?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," I realise I dont have any right to start get all parenty on you
and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isnt paying attention and is busy
mimicking the puppy.) uhh Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,
its very important. "
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," I mean, I know what Im talking about. I gave up two babies, and
I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible
it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every
single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it
would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy
again, and not listening) I really shouldnt have given you the puppy first."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," All right, Im sorry."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my
friend Ross."
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide, You mean Dr. Geller?
0,season4,411towpu,Joey, Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide," Oh, he wont sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit
over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Well, how-how come?"
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide, Thats just the way it is.
0,season4,411towpu,Joey, Thats crazy.
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide," Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats
and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in
the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but
now(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! Its me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my
puddin which you man! I gave you my <em>Snack Pack</em>! (to Joey) See, he pretend
he dont even here me!"
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. Anyway,
look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is
one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he will sit
in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I
saved you seat."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you
later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide," Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," (entering) Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in
the cafeteria today."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never
sit together."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey, Whatever.
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Its like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where
you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other
chefs, right?"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. Yknow you wear a
white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so
be it. Yknow, hey I understand. Yknow? Hey, when Im in a play and
youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? So its yknow,
its uh, its cool. Ill see you tomorrow. (Leaves)"
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he
does wave."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Hi.
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Ooh, yknow what, I think its time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, lets go to the balcony."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, What?!
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Umm, the street. Come on, lets go to the street. Ooh, listen,
dont go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," (to Chandler) So, did you do it?"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Yes, yes, we had the sex."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Uh-oh, it was bad?"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as
strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, Im all
right with it."""
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Well, it was the first time. Yknow, theres not always a lot
of agreement the first time."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a
woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to
know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebodys killing her in
there!"""
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont
know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All
right. Now"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes
hot!"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than
three), five, six, and seven!"
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, (shocked) There are seven?!
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, (Points to one) Thats one?
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Its kind of an important one!
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler," Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
couldve meant.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, That-thats bad?
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Well if you go to <em>Disneyland</em>, you dont spend the whole
day on the Materhorn."
0,season4,411towpu,Chandler, Well you might if it were anything like 7!
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit
em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean
back on the couch satisfied.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Older Scientist," Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here. (Motions to
an empty chair at the white table.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here
in the middle. Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell
sit with me."
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table
and they shake hands.)"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something
unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow
what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in
blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these
coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat
and throws it down.) Im Ross! Im divorced, and I have a kid!"
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) Im Joey! Im an
actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!"
0,season4,411towpu,Another Tour Guide," (standing up and removing his coat) Im Ted, and I just
moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," All right, there you go!"
0,season4,411towpu,Joey," Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
0,season4,411towpu,Older Scientist," Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear."
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Okay, good-good for you."
0,season4,411towpu,Tour Guide," Im Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these arent
real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)"
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Wow, Rhonda."
0,season4,411towpu,Another Scientist, Im Scott.
0,season4,411towpu,Ross," Yeah, okay, Scott!"
0,season4,411towpu,Another Scientist," And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times
before I leave a room or my family will die."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," My moms gonna be here any minute. I cant do this, I
cant give him up. Yesno, I can. I dont want to. But I can. No."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Oo, I cant watch this, its like <em>Sophies Choice</em>."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica," Yknow, I never saw that."
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Ooh, it was only okay."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Ooh, I cant do this. My mom was right. If I cant-if I
cant give him up, then theres no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and
Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ema
kidney!"
0,season4,411towpu,Alice, (entering with Frank) Hi!
0,season4,411towpu,Frank, Hi!
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Yeah, so we just thought wed stop by and let you know theres
still no pressure."
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, were just
gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," (noticing the puppy) Oh, whos this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)"
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Oh! Ooh! Umm!
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Oh, hes so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour."
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," You are so precious, I could just take you home."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Hey, why dont you?"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank, Are you serious?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah!"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Oh, thanks."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, What are you doing?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," No, Im really okay with this. Yknow why? Cause look at
them, and I made that, so I know its gonna be like a million times harder to
give up a baby but, oh my God, its gonna feel like a million times better, right? I
wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby."
0,season4,411towpu,Alice," (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You dont know what this
means to us! Oh!"
0,season4,411towpu,Frank," Oh my God, I think Im gonna cry!"
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Its gonna be so great.
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr, (entering) Hi! Whats going on?
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided
Im gonna carry their baby."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr, But Phoebe
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe," No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe Sr," Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but its justthat was my
puppy."
0,season4,411towpu,Phoebe, Oh!
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, It depends on who asked.
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, What if I asked?
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel," Oh, Mon, sure."
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, Really?
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, Yes. (Pause) Youre not asking are you?
0,season4,411towpu,Monica, No.
0,season4,411towpu,Rachel, Yes! Totally!
0,season4,411towpu,Kathy," Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to
Chandler)"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is
that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)
Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joeys with Monica in trail.) "
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Boy, you are really not a morning person."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get
up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, What is that noise?
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, You!
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Its the chick! Shesgoing through some changes.
0,season4,412towte,Monica, What kind of changes?
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.
(The rooster crows.) Were getting a second opinion."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Well, Ive been up since six. Thanks to somebodys
dumb-ass rooster."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldnt
be living in an apartment."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," All right. Im gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if
Im ready to have Frank and Alices embryo transferred into my uterus."
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Now, how will they know if youre ready?"
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Oh, theyre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is
thick."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Oh, I can uh, check that for ya."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Okay everyone, think thick."
0,season4,412towte,All, Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Hi! Wish me luck!
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Oh, good luck."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Good luck. (to Monica) And Im still right!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, That is sooo not true!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, What?
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means
shes wearing her old lady underpants."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, I can check that for ya.
0,season4,412towte,Monica," I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better than we know you."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even
numbers."
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Yeah, whats that about?"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," (to Rachel) And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels
bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there."
0,season4,412towte,Ross," (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) Youre good.
(Tries a cookie.) These are not."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Im so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Yeah.
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?"
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Five.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, How many guesses do you get?
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Six.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Challenge extended.
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Deal!
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Challenge excepted.
0,season4,412towte,Joey," All right, well start withapples."
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Well be starting with apples.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, (to Ross) Stop that now!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Yes!
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Diet soda.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Yes. Yes. Yes. (Theyre perfect so far.)
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Orange juice.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, No! Theres no orange juice in there! We win!! 
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Ha-ha!
0,season4,412towte,Ross, They have another guess.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Okay, well, we won that one."
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Okay, the last thing"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear.)"
0,season4,412towte,Joey," No-no, not for like another two weeks."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, I got it! Scotch tape. (Theyre right.)
0,season4,412towte,Ross, How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Well, we used theres up last night making scary faces."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Aww, man!"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme
it."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal
questions."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Serious?
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Are you scared?
0,season4,412towte,Joey," No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?"
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Ross will do it.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Oh sure, ""Ross will do it!"" Its not like he has a job, or
a child, or a life of his own."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Fine! Well ask Phoebe.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," No-no-no, I-I wanna play."
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane, It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
0,season4,412towte,Frank," Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em
in there."
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane," Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane," Um-hmm, five actually."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the
stairs?"
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane," We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will
attach."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75
percent chance of no baby at all!"
0,season4,412towte,Frank," Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you
stuff like 200 of them in there?"
0,season4,412towte,Alice," Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause
Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."
0,season4,412towte,Frank," Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot
to make it right."
0,season4,412towte,Alice," Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, were kinda
using all the money we have to do it just this one time."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a lot of pressure on me and my
uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is thereis maybe is there something that I
can do yknow just to like help make sure I get pregnant?"
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane," No, Im sorry."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
0,season4,412towte,Frank," I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in
my high school."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?"
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Huh.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," I know! I know, its such a huge, life-altering thing."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, I know.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, The test is ready.
0,season4,412towte,All," Yeah! Yes! (They all right into the living room, all excited.)"
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the
most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History,
Literature, and Its All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He
flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him,
to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time."
0,season4,412towte,All, Oh yeah!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Tails!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Its heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Fears and Pet Peeves.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, What is Monicas biggest pet peeve?
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Animals dressed as humans.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Thats correct. Ladies?
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Same category?
0,season4,412towte,Ross," According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?"
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!"
0,season4,412towte,Ross, That is correct.
0,season4,412towte,Joey, (to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Gentlemen, youre pick."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Its All Relative.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral,
name that grandmother!"
0,season4,412towte,Joey, (to Chandler) Nana?
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, She has a real name.
0,season4,412towte,Joey, (answering the question) Althea!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Althea?! What are you doing?! 
0,season4,412towte,Joey, I took a shot.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, You're shooting with Althea?!
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Althea is correct.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Nice shooting!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Well take Literature!!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joeys apartment. What
name appears on the address label?"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Chandler gets it! Its Chandler Bing!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, No!!
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Im afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
0,season4,412towte,Monica, I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Actually, its Miss Chinandolor Bong."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Hello, tiny embryos. Well, Im-Im Phoebe Buffay, hi!
Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should
know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been
there! Umm, yknow they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab
on. Okay, and-and I promise that Ill keep you safe and warm until youre ready
to have them take you home, so Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, Im
screaming, dont worry, thats whats supposed to happen."
0,season4,412towte,Dr. Zane, Ready?
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you
miss this the game is theirs, pick your category."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, (shouting) Its All Relative!!
0,season4,412towte,Ross, You dont have to shout everything.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, (shouting) Im sorry!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Ooh. What is the name of Chandlers fathers Las Vegas all-male
burlesque?"
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Viva Las Gaygas!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Unfortunately that is correct.
0,season4,412towte,The Girls, Yes!!
0,season4,412towte,Ross," All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He
opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!"
0,season4,412towte,All, Ohhhh.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroy
you."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Huh, wanna bet?"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing so
far"
0,season4,412towte,Monica," How about we play for more money, say 150?"
0,season4,412towte,Ross, 150 dollars.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Say 200?
0,season4,412towte,Ross, 200 dollars.
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Youre doing it again.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Excuse me.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Monica, I dont want to lose 200 dollars."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, We wont. (to Chandler) 300?
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Monica?!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Im just trying to spice it up!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Okay, so lets play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!"
0,season4,412towte,Monica," I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Oooohh thats interesting.
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Hey, no way, that roosters family!"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Throw in the duck too!
0,season4,412towte,Joey, What do you have against the duck?! He doesnt make any noise!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Well, he gets the other one all riled up."
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Look, we are not gonna"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," But if we win, we get your apartment."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Oooooh!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Deal!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game!
Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
0,season4,412towte,Monica," No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," All right, lets do it."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Come on!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Okay. (They go into the living room.)
0,season4,412towte,Ross," All right, gentlemen, youre up first."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Okay.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
0,season4,412towte,Ross," You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it (Chandler
stops jumping)now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey
goalie?"
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Big fat goalie.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie

0,season4,412towte,Ross, Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear and then in Rosss
ear.)"
0,season4,412towte,Ross," Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many
categories are there?"
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Everyday use.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Fancy.
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Guest.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Fancy guest.
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Two seconds
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Uhh, 11!"
0,season4,412towte,Ross," 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right,
thats 4 for the guys. Ladies, youre up. "
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, All right!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Come on!

0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, And processing.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, He carries a briefcase.
0,season4,412towte,Ross," 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Its umm, it has something to do with transponding."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, hes a transponcetranspondster!"
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Thats not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
0,season4,412towte,Monica, NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Oh my God.
0,season4,412towte,Chandler and Joey, YEAH!!! YES!!!
0,season4,412towte,Joey, I call Monicas room!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, You cant just call Monicas room.
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, Im sight of the room and I
called it."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Man, I feel like Im coming down with something."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, What?
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you cant guess what color my tonsils
are? Ill bet the apartment!"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Heyooh Pheebs, are they in there?"
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Umm, yeah, uh-huh, theyre implanted."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, How do you feel?
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky.
And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally
putting all of their eggs in my basket."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Yeah, but I bet it works."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Really?! How much?!
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," All right, Im gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now."
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my bodys always
been a little faster than Western medicine. "
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," (entering from Chandlers bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball
table.) Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in
here!"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, Well believe it baby!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Well I-I-Im not moving.
0,season4,412towte,Joey, What?!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!"
0,season4,412towte,Joey," You cant just ignore the bet! Its a bet! You bet and you bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet!"
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldve
made them get rid of the birds. Right?"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Noooo.
0,season4,412towte,Monica," All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel
better, its all your fault."
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, What?!
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!"
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, I knew it!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," I dont care, Im not going anywhere."
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Cool, girl roommate."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Well?
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Nope, not knocked up yet."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Its only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, Im gonna do whatever I can to help
this so, Im just gonna yknow, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair
and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, Im let gravity
yknow, do its jobs."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment
and I like it! This is a girls apartment! That is a boys apartment, its
dirty and it smells. This is pretty. Its-its so pretty! And look, and
its-its purple! And Im telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not
moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is
shaking uncontrollably.) "
0,season4,412towte,Monica, Ill take care of it.
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Thats right! You do what the hand says!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, How did it go?
0,season4,412towte,Monica, I lost our mattresses.
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," (singing) ""<em>Are you in there little fetus</em>? <br/>
                            
<em>In nine will you come great us</em>? <br/>

0,season4,412towte,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,412towte,Frank and Alice, (entering) Hi!
0,season4,412towte,Alice," Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little
present."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
0,season4,412towte,Frank," Umm, its a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test."
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Hey, dont mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop."
0,season4,412towte,Alice," So umm, you feel like taking a test? Theres only one question."
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, yknow just remember that
its still really early, okay so, if it says that Im not pregnant, that
doesnt mean that Im not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please,
just so I dont go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this."
0,season4,412towte,Alice, Okay.
0,season4,412towte,Frank, Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe, Great. (Goes to take the test.)
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
0,season4,412towte,Joey," Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
0,season4,412towte,Monica," Hey, we would still be living here if hadnt gotten the question
wrong!"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Well it stupid, unfair question!"
0,season4,412towte,Ross, Dont blame the questions!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler," Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving
day for us!"
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, Will you stop calling it your apartment!
0,season4,412towte,Joey, But it is our apartment!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel, No its not!
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," You guys! You guys! Youre gonna have a baby! Theyre gonna
have a baby!"
0,season4,412towte,Frank, MY SISTERS GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
0,season4,412towte,Phoebe," Okay, but this cant be good for the baby."
0,season4,412towte,All, Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
0,season4,412towte,Monica, I cant find garbage bags!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," Oh, I think I saw some in here. "
0,season4,412towte,Monica, What is it?!
0,season4,412towte,Rachel," I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll
die."
0,season4,412towte,Monica, I cant believe were living here!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, What?! What-what is it?!
0,season4,412towte,Joey, Did you see the size of the closets?!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler, I cant believe we live here!
0,season4,412towte,Chandler and Joey, Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I

0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy's Co-Star, Hi!
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, Hi!
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, That is one good looking man!
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy's Co-Star," Sooo, youve been doing this long?"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," No, youre my first. Put the money on the table."
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy's Co-Star," Oh, yeah! Ooh, thats nice. (They start making out
harder.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Dude!
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy's Co-Star, Is that an expensive blouse?
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, If you want it to be. 
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Heres your girlfriends button. (Holding the button.)
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from
high school?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? "
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If
you could just(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)throw your purses at
it."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, <em>Bloomingdales </em>eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge
step down!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty
rich people and tell them what to buy?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, That sounds great!
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food
anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, (Holding a turkey leg) Theres gravy?
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over
all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
(She takes back the turkey leg)"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, What are you doing?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, I think I left a donut up here.
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Hey!

0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Ooh! How was Kathys play?
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good
lookin guy."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst
nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Thats a good idea for a business!
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on
stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes
gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, ""So wheres your
boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?"" And shell go, ""No-no-no,
its Chandler."" And hell go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Chandler, look theyre actors. Theyre there to do a job, just
cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. I mean
just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt mean
its gonna happen with them."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Theyre not a couple!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Oh-okay, I get the game now."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on
stage, was it like really hot?"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Oh yeah!
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are
actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long
as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes
away, thats when youre in trouble."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler, Really?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever
had chemistry on stage?"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, No.
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Noooo!!
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how
hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yeah, I know but"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Oh no-no-no, Im there."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, You made pancakes?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Yep! Grab a plate.
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her
pancakes.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which
flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain
are the same thing."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday
night, if people want to come over."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Oh yeah!
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Oh yeah, whos playing?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, The players.
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," (laughs) Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her
plate.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," (on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old
woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you
Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah
really need to talk to you."
0,season4,413towrc,Mr. Waltham," In a moment, please, Im in the middle of a task. And you have
a customer. "
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Hi!
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Hi, Im Joshua."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Hi, Im Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Oh, Im so sorry."
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This
suit and what turned out to be a skirt."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Well, at least thats a great suit."
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Yeah, but it wasnt much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in
the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if youre
willing, Im all yours."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,413towrc,Mr. Waltham," Rachel, you needed to speak to me?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," No-no, that wasnt me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let
me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way. (Motions to the
correct way.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Its this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his
butt.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.
Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey
told us what this means!"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," All right, lets not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was
some sexual chemistry between them."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Here she comes. Dont say a word, okay? Just be cool, dont
bey'know you."
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, Hey you guys!
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it
tonight?"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, Wasnt Nick funny when he couldnt get his match lit?
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Its a good play, isnt it?"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly
youre having sex with him."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Okay, I (Walks away.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Clearly, Im having sex with him?"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youre accusing me of
cheating on you, and insulting my performance?"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youre
up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing."
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a
play! How can you not trust me?!"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well, you can understand, given how we started."
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying
this!"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy," Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you
grow up!"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over
today, and I got to dress him up all day!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Rachel has a new doll.
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them
together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised
it, Joshua! Josh-<strong>u</strong>-a! Joshua! Josh."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Uh, hello!"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Hi-e!!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Ooh, what do I smell?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," I dont know, it smells good."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Please, have some!"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Oh, yumm!"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Yeah, Ive just been fiddling around in here making delicious
treats for everyone."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new <em>Playboy</em>!
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Yeah, its just something I picked up."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Cookies and porn, youre the best mom ever!!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, What? What?
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be
there."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Its Joshua.
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his
apartment. Joey follows him)"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, Wait! Wait! This isnt take-out!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," No, wait, please dont go! Ive got porn for you too!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Yeah, I dont need it."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Why? Honey, what is the big deal?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Im the hostess! Not those guys! Im always the hostess! I
mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought
their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone
has to hang out in the big apartment?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But
Im-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," If you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out
here! "
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Yeah, thats true."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna be
ten times better than that place!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Oh, are we gonna trash that place?"
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at
the new <em>Playboy</em>) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the <em>Playboy </em>behind
their backs. Chandler wonders into the girls apartment.) You will all be very happy
to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!"
0,season4,413towrc,All, What?!
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, So you were right?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," I confronted her, and she didnt deny it! (Pause) I dont
live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Chandler!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Chandler, what did she say?"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Wait a minute.
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Come here.
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, Are you sure?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to <em>Beefsteak
Julies</em>"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, <em>Beefsteak Charlies</em>?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yes! See you and I have always been like(motions that they think
the same.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joeys.) Oh, hey, do you
need help with that?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Nah, I got it."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and
Joeys.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Hi!
0,season4,413towrc,All, Hey!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
Its just so frustrating!"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Why dont you ask him out?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Oh, yeah, totally! Thats such a turn-on!"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Really? It doesnt seem desperate?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, He just got a divorce right? 
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Hmm-mmm.
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," So hes probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you
just have to make the first move."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Yeah but, Ive never asked a guy out before."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, (shocked) Youve never asked a guy out?!!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, No. Have you?
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Thousands of times!! That doesnt make me sound too good does it?
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, I dont even know how I would go about it.
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,
""Hey, how you doin?"""
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," Oh, please!"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," You know what, Im gonna do that, Im gonna call him up, and
Im gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin?
(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? Its Rachel Green from <em>Bloomingdales</em>.
(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store
today? Well, we found a wallet, and we(Listens) the license? Well, that is a
good idea! Uh, well, lets see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,
belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. Ill
see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) Youve done that a thousand times?"
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Ive never done that.
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. Like uh,
Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youre guaranteed hell say
yes!"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Really?! You think that will work?
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Absolutely! And if it doesnt, can I get the extra ticket?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, What the heck is that?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler, Did she call?
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe," No, sorry."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," All right, maybe I should call her."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Hes right, what she did was unforgivable."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, How might you be wrong?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.
Back me up here, Ross!"
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Thats all youre basing this on?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and
the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories
that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler, Oh my God!!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You
know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too (Tries again.)
Umm, who likes the Knicks(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua, What do you think?
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the
mirror.) Yeah?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how
they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like
it?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think Im gonna wear it home."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Great.
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," All right, thank you so much for all your help. "
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Sure.
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Yeah-eah-ha!
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe Ill see in the spring, with the
uh, yknow, for the uh, bathing suits."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Oh well, you dont want to do that now?!"
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Ah, thats okay, thanks."
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Anyway, hopefully, Ill see you around sometime. (He goes out the
door.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Basketball!
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua, (coming back in) Im sorry.
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if youre
interested, just as a thank you for this week."
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua, Wow! That would be great.
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Really?
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua," Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.
Waltham returns.)"
0,season4,413towrc,Mr. Waltham, Good morning.
0,season4,413towrc,Joshua, Hi!
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, (opening the door) Hey.
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry.
Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely
understand why you were so upset."
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, Oh wow. I really wish youd call me.
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a
good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on.
Yknow, I know for me(Notices a pair of mens pants on the chair.)
Nicks pants?"
0,season4,413towrc,Kathy, Yeah.
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an
extra ticket."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," He didnt turn me down! Hes at the game isnt he? I got
the date, Im just not on it!"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," (entering) Okay, its ready. Come on."
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Whats ready?
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, Just come. 
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Oh my God!
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Wow! Monica!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Great!
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, This is beautiful!
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Oh did youwhat did youdid you work for two days straight?
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?"
0,season4,413towrc,Joey," I dont know, it looks the same."
0,season4,413towrc,Monica, You used to have carpet.
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Oh yeah!
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? Im just gonna rest
my eyes just a little bit."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?"
0,season4,413towrc,Monica," Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. Im always the
hostess."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,413towrc,Joey, Howd it go?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Well, she wasnt sleeping with him."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, Oh good!
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler, She is now.
0,season4,413towrc,Ross, What are you saying?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Im saying that she is a devil woman! Yknow I mean
you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with
his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I
dont hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really."
0,season4,413towrc,Phoebe, How? How is your fault?
0,season4,413towrc,Chandler," Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just called
her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they
wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it
does not justify her sleeping with someone."
0,season4,413towrc,Ross," Well, if-if she thought they were on a break"
0,season4,413towrc,Mr. Waltham," Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A
Joshua Bergen. "
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel, Really?
0,season4,413towrc,Mr. Waltham, Will you call him?
0,season4,413towrc,Rachel," Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and
holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in <em>Spaceballs</em>,
and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my
wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, Im glad.
Rachel, Id like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin?"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Guggly worm.
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Glow-pop giggly jammer.
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, (laughs harder) You make it so funny.
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, whats
this?"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the
sandwich)"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Gellers got one hooked!
Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) Its the
classic struggle between man and(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone
knocked over a lamp."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," (going over and picking up the rod) Thats all right. Hey you guys,
you know whats going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets
me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with
your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, Im doing a movie with Charlton Heston
dad. What are you doing with your life?"""
0,season4,414jdd,All, Great!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here.
Kathy didnt cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler
goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Hey, Joey, I dont think that you should leave Chandler alone. I
mean its only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing
next week?"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Look, theres nothing I can do for him right now, hes still in
his sweat pants, thats still Phase One. Y'know? Ill be back for Phase Two, I
would never miss Phase Two."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Whats Phase Two?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Gettin drunk and going to a strip club. 
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, How does going to a strip club help him better?
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Because there are naked ladies there.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, There are naked ladies there too.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Yeah.
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would
you give me one minute!! Please."
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at
his ass.) There we go. There it is."
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua, (turning around) Oh! You know what I need? 
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, okay. Uhh, well lets see. (Grabs his hand.) Youre
aboutwell uh, this one is large. And this one(Grabs the other hand.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua, Also large?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!"
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua, Okay.
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham, (entering) Rachel! Could I have a moment?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Yes.
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from Londonwell
Shropshire really but yknowwell shes about your age I say. Anyway I have
tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if youd like to keep her
company this evening?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Sure. You got it. Great! 
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," Oh, good."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Me, Fledermaus, great. I really(motions to Joshua.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much."
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," So(Holds out his hands as to say, ""Where are my
gloves?"")"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and
hoping for something more intimate.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua, Gloves?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, Ill be right back!"
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," Uhh, actually yknow what, I kindaI have to take off. "
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Oh.
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, No! Nothing!
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," I invested in this night-club and its opening tonight, would you
like to come?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Yeah! That would be great!
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua, Youre into hardcore S&amp;M right?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," (shocked) Well, I-I guessI"
0,season4,414jdd,Joshua," Kidding! (Rachel is relived) Im gonna get there early, but
Im going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Yeah, great, you betcha!"
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," (entering) I almost forget the tickets, didnt I?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, What?
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh. Oh, right."
0,season4,414jdd,Mr. Waltham," I think youll like it, it has two out of the three tenors."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Oh yay!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Yknow, I cant believe Kathy did this too me. I really,
thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on Im never getting out of
this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the
one? My sweat pants!"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take em off
and well have some fun."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, (entering) Hey-hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Hi!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Oh my God, you guys have no idea. "
0,season4,414jdd,All, (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, You stink!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Are you kidding?!
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big
tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-hows he doing?"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, He hasnt gotten out of that chair in two days.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! Hows it going?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come
home. All right, uh, Ive got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me
and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Hey, Monica!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Uh-oh, whats the matter?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Ohh, its Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.
So What are you gonna do?"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, I dont know sweetie.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, No! Help me!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, I cant! I have to work!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Phoebe?
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. "
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Ugh!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this isI have to meet Joshua! This
is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Yknow the ""Wouldnt it be
great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," No, Chandlers still in Phase One, and Joeys that thing you
smell."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Hi!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, So.
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, No.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Ohhhh, come on!!!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, I think shes here.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," You want me to take some girl Ive never met to the opera so you can
go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," (looking out the peephole) Ohh, shes looking down the hall. Oh!
She looked right at me! Oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, can
you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Ill be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I
thought we have moved on! I thought weve gotten to a place where we could be happy
for each other! I mean was that just me?"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," All right, Ill do it."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)
Emily?"
0,season4,414jdd,Emily, Yes.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Im Rachel Green.
0,season4,414jdd,Emily, Thank goodness.
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Theres been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that
Im not free tonight. So"
0,season4,414jdd,Emily," Really?! Well, thats just lovely, isnt it? I mustve
missed your call, even though I didnt leave the flat all day. "
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh well, no I"
0,season4,414jdd,Emily," Oh, no-no-no, thats not rude! Its perfectly in keeping with a
trip that Ive already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been
strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone
whos got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, I-I-I think you look great.
0,season4,414jdd,Emily," Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Ill get her.
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Please hurry.
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Dont you just love the way they talk?!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Ohh!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, What?
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on
the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have
time! Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Heywhoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey
runs off.) Wow!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Well, I didnt see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl
in the face."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, What?
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Why?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and
she was all, ""Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!"" and he let her
right in. "
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, So you hit her in the face?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal
my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I cant believe this, all I wanted was a few
hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Honey, thats youre name."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Thats short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called
each other!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Hey! Youre wearing pants!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk and
see some strippers."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Its 9
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, They got a breakfast buffet.
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Ooh, let me talk to him!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Oh-oh, my God!"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Well, can I just"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Shhh!! Please! Whats he saying?
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Hes with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, What? Oh my God!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, What? Who the hell is Emily(realises) noooo!!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms
franticly and hits Chandler.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Ow!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits
Chandler again.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time. "
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who
wouldnt be miserable? Im telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person."
0,season4,414jdd,Emily," (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! Theres a deer just outside eating
fruit from the orchard!"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Ive gotta go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," I dont get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Okay, Im going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into
the living room.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Why do you care so much anyway?
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," I dont care! All right, yknow what Im just upset that
Im getting nowhere with Joshua thatyknow what still, you do not meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember
everylittlething!! (Storms out.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," So yknow, uh, whens he getting back?"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, A couple of days.
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He
starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go back
in time."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase
Two strip club thing with us."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, (laughs) No you cant.
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and
wouldnt live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and
you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Okay. (Starts to cry)
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Im sorry. (Goes and hugs him)
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! Im here! Im here! 
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D," Calm down, we got time, were running a little late."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D," Yeah, we loves em. Ive never seen him with(He gets a
whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," (trying to act like hes not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what
the hell is that? What smells so bad?"
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D, You.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yknow, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who
I think it is?"
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D, You?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," No-no, its uh, its Heston."
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D, What?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and
then ate some liquorice. "
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D," Theres no way he smells, hes the only one around here with
a shower in his dressing room."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
0,season4,414jdd,The A.D," The one with ""Heston"" on it."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Interesting.
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, Ive
got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," No thanks, Mom!"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause
Im pregnant."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancers hot
pants) so good."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt
call. I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Come on! Look where you are!!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Remember, a virgin for me please."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet
guy."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im
just gonna go home and call Kathy."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Well, if you think it will help."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get really
drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,
Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, You should! How is she?
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Ohhh!!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston," Hello! Whos in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a
naked and wet Joey.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, How ya doin?
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston, Who in the hell are you?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston, Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, Im an actor, Joey Tribbiani,
Im doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston, (shocked) Youre in this picture?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yeah-yeah, Im one of the cops that wont work with you
cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, Im really sorry, but I stink!"
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston," Joey, right?"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, Yeah.
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston," (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower
and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or anotheropp! (Joey tries to
sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he
stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford wont even
watch himself."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Oh no-no-no, you dont understand"
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston, Listen to me!
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Oh yeah, yeah."
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston," I dont know one actor worth his salt that didnt say
at one time or another, ""God, I stink!"" Hell, I just did a scene out there,
first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter
how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and
use my shower! Do you understand me?!"
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yes sir! Yes sir, Im-Im(he starts to leave)"
0,season4,414jdd,Charlton Heston, Wait a minute! Take your pants.
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yeah. Oh, yeah."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," So, we did okay at the strip club, right?"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress
there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, (entering) I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Who, Josh?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Its Joshua.
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," What, he doesnt like Josh?"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No, I dont."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on."
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were
right. We really werent great at being guys, but you know why? Because were
girls."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, And do you know what girls are really good at?
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Stripping!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," No, listening! Sit! Yknow, maybe it would just really, really help
if you would just talk."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Yeah, come on! Whats going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Okay, look, Im gonna have to ask you all to leave."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Come on! Chandler!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them.
(Sits back in disgust.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," They really were pretty, werent they? (Rachel and Phoebe both
agree)"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! "
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Yknow, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is
intrigued.) Itd, itd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so
petite."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," See, I dont know, for me it would have to Chantal."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Oh, Chantal!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that
dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Really?!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, I am totally picturing you with all those women!
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Thats-thats not Phase Three.
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Well, Im there too!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Well, are we all together? Like in a group?"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Stop it! Youre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase
Four!"
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe, Oh! What is that? What is that?
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Where I dont want to have a relationship ever! I just want to
have sex with strippers and my friends!!"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Come on, let me see that smile."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, I dont wanna.
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler, Please?
0,season4,414jdd,Joey, I wanted to go to the strip club!
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," I know, I know, but youre gonna have plenty of chances. There
are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
0,season4,414jdd,Joey," Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," Heyooh so, how was Vermont?"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Emily isincredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,
I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)
Oh! And you! Rach!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, hey!"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Hey! You were so right!
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, What?
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be
happy for each other. "
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, hmm."
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasnt quite there. Yknow, I mean the
thought of you and that-that Josh guy"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel, Joshua.
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Joshuaguy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought
of it kindayknow."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Yeah, I"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," But now! Im there! Im totally there! Im-Im finally
where you are!"
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, thank goodness!"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross," Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," Oh, no problem. Im so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She
playfully punches him.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Ross, Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," All right ladies, heres what were gonna do. (Points to a
stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,
go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your
voice, ""Chandlers the king! Chandlers the king!"""
0,season4,414jdd,Phoebe," I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
0,season4,414jdd,Monica," Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any
moment!"
0,season4,414jdd,The Cigarette Guy," Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel."
0,season4,414jdd,Rachel," No-no-no, that not Joshua."
0,season4,414jdd,Chandler," What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. So anyway,
Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with
the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy
starts rubbing Chandlers back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,
listen, Ive got to wake up!"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And <strong>you</strong>
said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be
other guys here. There are no other guys here!"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Chandler, theres a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman! (Waves to the
mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a
guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does!
(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate
to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Hmm.
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Ohh, Nothing."
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," Didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it
did?"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, I know what it did! Nothing.
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! How
can you not care?"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Like this. (Shrugs)
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Well, heres another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that
silver knob on the toilet does?"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Sure! It flushes it.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind
actually using it?"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Guess who we ran into today?!
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Janice?!
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, Isnt this amazing? 
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, How have you been?
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh well, Im divorced."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Ohhh, wow."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Yeah, Im riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, And there it is.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," I just came up to say, ""Hi!"" Hi! (to Chandler) And you,
sweetie, Ill see you tonight."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, Okay. Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, B-bye!
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Bye-bye.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) I
cant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before
we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all
back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight.
(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to break
up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike!
Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the
fridge.) "
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around
and then back at Joey.) Im tellin ya!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," I cant believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such
stories about New York."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," No, its really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly
safe."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing
them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross."
0,season4,415rugby,Devon," Hey, mate."
0,season4,415rugby,Liam, How are ya man?
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," So how are you? Ive been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived
but umm, well, Ive been rather busy."
0,season4,415rugby,Devon," Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that
U2 concert?"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Oh my God. I think youre right.
0,season4,415rugby,Liam," (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each
other was that morning."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingor
should I call it (In an English accent) football?"
0,season4,415rugby,Devon, We were playing rugby.
0,season4,415rugby,Liam," In fact were playing a game at the park tomorrow. Youre
welcome to play too if you want."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, (laughs) Ross play rugby? I dont think so.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Whats ah, whats so funny about that?"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Well I mean, youre American to start with. You dont even have
rugby here."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Well, we didnt have freedom here until 1776, either so"
0,season4,415rugby,Devon, So good then! Well see you at Riverside Park at 2
0,season4,415rugby,Liam, Cheers!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, Cheers!
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh boy, I just love to sing!"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were
complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing <i>Old Man River</i>."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at
14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very
serious relationship"
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about
meant to be!"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away
this time."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me
overseas!"
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," No! No! Not, Paris. "
0,season4,415rugby,Janice,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.
Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!"
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, When?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, I dont know exactly.
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Done?
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, Yep!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," (entering, with Joey) Hey!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Hey! Whats up?
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and
checked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of them
has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets
that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out
which one it is."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then
followed the light."
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," Yeah, well, Im using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody
ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear
something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Its coming from Joey!
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Oh my God, thats so freaky! Turn him off!!"
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Oh, just hold on a second. Im watching this rugby thing on <i>ESPN</i>.
I dont know what the big deal is. Im man enough to play this sport."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that
carries the sport."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, (entering) Hey there Ross!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, (shocked) Hey!
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, (whispering to Ross) Janice.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and
the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Hey-hey, whats going on?"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing
cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Thanks for telling me!
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the
only way I can get rid off her."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, Im gonna show how
to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. Its a real space saver."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Okay, Chandler, come on!"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I cant believe you said
youd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Hey, I can handle it! All right?"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Thats cause-cause youre moms dog kept-kept
looking at me."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.
Thats called a scrum, okay? Its kinda like a huddle."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, Ross! (Laughs) Theyre gonna kill you!
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Well, you shouldve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I
mean, hes like Joe Rugby."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Youre kidding! And he plays rugby?! Thats so funny.
(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was
like hilarious. So Im gonna show her how tough I really am!"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) Im sorry. Im sorry.
Youre right, you are a tough guy. Youre the toughest palaeontologist I know."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like
hesChandler!"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, (from his bedroom) Thanks!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Look, dont worry about me. Okay? Ill just stay real energetic
and stay away from the ball. Ill uh, Ill be that guy right out of the circle.
(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)"
0,season4,415rugby,All, Oh!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him."
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy
(Points). And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, They dont look any bigger than me!
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, All right.
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.) 
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, (to the player) Hi.
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross. (Joey and
Phoebe dont know what hes talking about.) Yknow, Red Ross!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, I totally dont know what youre talking about.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for <i>Dances With Wolves </i>and
that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all
red! Red Ross!!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, No.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, Youll see.
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, its his
first time."
0,season4,415rugby,Liam," You dont say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and
spikes it in his face.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," (to Ross) Good luck, babe."
0,season4,415rugby,Liam, Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!
0,season4,415rugby,Liam," Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, JOEY!!!!!!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,
and guess what happened?"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, He asked you out?!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Saucy!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, (refers to the table) What are these?
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Electrical plans for the building.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall
and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Wow! If only more people knew.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had
to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont
really seem to care too much that youre leaving."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Well, were really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this
is uh, good-bye then."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on
that plane."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign
that says, Wait Here."") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
0,season4,415rugby,Ticket Counter Attendant, One ticket to Yemen?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
0,season4,415rugby,Ticket Counter Attendant," Im sorry sir, I dont understand. "
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
0,season4,415rugby,Ticket Counter Attendant, Are you travelling with a child?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," No. All right, yknow what, shes (Points to Janice) gonna
think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand
you a library card."
0,season4,415rugby,Ticket Counter Attendant," Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont
take library cards."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, (to the ticket agent) <i>American Express</i>?
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," I cant believe theyre doing that to him! I told them to go
easy on him!"
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," No offence but, yknow sometimes its hard to understand you,
yknow with the accent, so"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Thats just halftime, theres more of this."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Right.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle
of water? "
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Okay.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Thanks. (When shes gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think Im
dying. I really do. "
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Oh, poor baby."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)
Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Ross, they are killing you out there!"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," (whines ""No."") Thats not true!"
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe, Shes right! You have to stop!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help
you."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things
that might help you inflict some pain."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, I like that.
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. "
0,season4,415rugby,Ross, Huh?
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, One swift kick and hell back off.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," All right, bad ankle, got it!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh,
and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell
go down like a lamp."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," But-but, Liams on my team."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, I dont care! You just get him!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a
madman.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey, The Red Ross! Okay.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Hey!
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, Hi!
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that werent there
originally.) What-what are-what are these?"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd
brighten up the place. They do dont you think?"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," No-no-no, no!"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that
picture."
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Oh my God! Look at this!
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is
connected to something!"
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it
did."
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, And did you?!
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs."
0,season4,415rugby,Monica, But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Oh my God.
0,season4,415rugby,Mrs. Chatracus, Hello darling.
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel," Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Now, are you sure you dont want to go see a doctor?"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Oh no! That-thatll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I
was great! This is a great day! Yknow what? Im buying everyone coffee. All
right? If someone would just grab my wallet, its in my pocket. "
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Yeah, sure."
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," No, not you. (Emily gets it.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Joey," Uhh, look, your eyes still popping out a little, Im gonna go
get some ice."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and
the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, You were amazing out there.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Oh, I kinda was, wasnt I?"
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, Oh my God!
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I havent done that since I
was four and I washed my dads Porsche with rocks."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, You really enjoyed yourself didnt you?
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody
noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. And its all because of
you, wonderful, amazing you."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily, I think youve got concussion.
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," No, no, Im serious. Thank you."
0,season4,415rugby,Emily," Youre welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) Im
sorry. Did I hurt you?"
0,season4,415rugby,Ross," Its worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Yknow what,
you know what? Its not."
0,season4,415rugby,Ticket Counter Attendant," (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for
Flight 664 to Yemen."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long
youre going to be gone?"
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
0,season4,415rugby,Janice," Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen
Road, Yemen."
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. "
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Chandler?
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler, No!
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, Chandler! 
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and
also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
0,season4,415rugby,Janice, No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
0,season4,415rugby,Chandler," Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!
(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," All right. The super couldnt figure out what it did. A $200 an
hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. Ive had seven pretty serious
shocks. I officially give up."
0,season4,415rugby,Rachel, Thank God.
0,season4,415rugby,Monica," I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
0,season4,415rugby,Phoebe," See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops
working.) I lost it."
0,season4,416party,Monica, What is it hon?
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," I-I cant find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes
me nauseous! Im telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cakeooh! Cake!
(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No."
0,season4,416party,Monica," Aww, honey Im sorry."
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," God! Ooh! What is that smell? Its coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
(She goes to the bathroom.)"
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
0,season4,416party,Joey, Yeah?
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Its me. Its Phoebe. Listen theres something in here I
want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
0,season4,416party,Joey, Is it the shampoo? Its guava.
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, (she smells his head) No!
0,season4,416party,Joey, Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Yes. Yes. Yes. I cant believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he
wants me to eat meat? I cant eat meat!"
0,season4,416party,Joey," Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe its a pickle?!"
0,season4,416party,Chandler, What are you writing?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, Joshuas coming in tomorrow and since I dont have the
guts to ask him out, Im going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."
0,season4,416party,Chandler," Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a
call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?"
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Hi guys!
0,season4,416party,All, Hey!
0,season4,416party,Joey," Hey, what have you guys been up too?"
0,season4,416party,Ross," Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the
Cupert-Hewitt museum."
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Without me?!
0,season4,416party,Emily," My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really
interesting."
0,season4,416party,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,416party,Emily," They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a
doorknob she has.)"
0,season4,416party,Monica," I dont know how museums work in England but, here, youre not
supposed to take stuff."
0,season4,416party,Emily," I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.
(Chandler is shocked.) Its a joke. (They all laugh.)"
0,season4,416party,Ross, Bye. (They kiss.)
0,season4,416party,Emily," Right, Ive got to be off, Ill see ya. Buh-bye then. (She
leaves.)"
0,season4,416party,Joey, Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
0,season4,416party,Ross," Oh yeah, shes-shes amazing. And-and shes so much fun.
And! Yknow what? When Im with her, Im fun! I even signed up for
helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) Shes leaving in two days, I dont
have to do it."
0,season4,416party,Monica," Oh no, two days, you must be bummed."
0,season4,416party,Ross," Yeah, shes got to go back to London. But you know what? Ive
been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and
thats it. Yknow."
0,season4,416party,Joey, Hey thats what all my relationships are like.
0,season4,416party,Chandler," Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeks
thats it."
0,season4,416party,Ross, Pheebs!
0,season4,416party,All, Hey!
0,season4,416party,Ross, (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is
totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, yknow? And I got nauseous."
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Thats sweat. You throw up all morning, youll have that glow
too."
0,season4,416party,Joshua, (coming in from a changing room) Okay!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, heres that trench-coat that you wanted."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, its comfortable. "
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his
hands in his pockets.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they dont want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Why not?!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, thats because of a lot of(She imitates someone picking
their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Yknow, they ruin it for everybody."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, I know!
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Yknow, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Oh?
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, congratulations, so do you love her?"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," No, no, no, shes nice but, yknow, it just it made me realize
that Im just not, Im just not ready to be dating, yknow?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Huh. Well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting. (She goes over
and retrieves her note.)"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, its just an anti-theft device."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Then uh, whats-whats this? (Shows her the real anti-theft
device.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we
have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
0,season4,416party,Chandler, What are you talking about?
0,season4,416party,Joey," Yeah, what going on?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But its
actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said hes not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)"
0,season4,416party,Ross," Well, as much as Id like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
arent going to be here. All right? I mean, shes going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then Ive got a whole special evening planned. So Im sorry, no
party."
0,season4,416party,Joey, Awwww!
0,season4,416party,Emily, (entering) Hello?
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Surprise!!!
0,season4,416party,Emily, No ones ever thrown me a surprise party before!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, it was all Rosss idea."
0,season4,416party,Emily, Youre so sweet! And Im so surprised!
0,season4,416party,Ross, You really didnt know?
0,season4,416party,Chandler," Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Uhh, because Im trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick hes
looking over here, say something funny."
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Like what?
0,season4,416party,Joey, What-what-what is so funny?
0,season4,416party,Chandler," I said, ""Like what?"""
0,season4,416party,Joey, Now thats a thinker.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Okay, yknow what, yknow what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!"
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Hi!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Care for a cherry?
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Oh, no thanks."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," No? Yknow, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue. "
0,season4,416party,Joshua," You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy
smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)"
0,season4,416party,Ross, (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
0,season4,416party,Emily," Oh, but the partys only just getting started!"
0,season4,416party,Ross," Yeah, but we-we have to be at the<i> Four Seasons</i> for drinks in 15
minutes and then yknow, then <i>The Plaza</i> for dinner."
0,season4,416party,Emily, So why did you plan a party at the same time?
0,season4,416party,Ross," No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. Its usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, Im so
surprisedgood-bye!"""
0,season4,416party,Emily," But Ross, Im such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea
parties."
0,season4,416party,Ross," Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monicas knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?"
0,season4,416party,Joey, A little salami. 
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?"
0,season4,416party,Joey, Pastrami. 
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Oooh, yeah. Youre a genius."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?"
0,season4,416party,Joey, Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Up!
0,season4,416party,Monica, You changed?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress."
0,season4,416party,Monica," And lucky means, more cleavage? "
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Does for me.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Ohh, God! Look at him, hes so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?"
0,season4,416party,Joey," Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, What?
0,season4,416party,Joey, There was a seen in <i>Footloose</i>...
0,season4,416party,Chandler, <i>Flashdance</i>.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl"
0,season4,416party,Chandler, She was a welder.
0,season4,416party,Joey," What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy."
0,season4,416party,Monica," Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Its not Christmas!
0,season4,416party,Monica, Or Spin the Bottle?
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Hes not 11!
0,season4,416party,Emily," (with her coat on, shes leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for
this. It was really so thoughtful of you."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, What? Youre leaving?!
0,season4,416party,Ross," Yes, we have something we have to get to."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Uhh, yeah, I think Im going to take-off too."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," No! You guys cant leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!"
0,season4,416party,Ross, What big thing?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this"
0,season4,416party,Emily, Ill go.
0,season4,416party,All, Yay!
0,season4,416party,Joey, Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
0,season4,416party,Monica," Two in a row! Youve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Yay! Emily! 
0,season4,416party,Chandler, What are the odds? What are the odds?
0,season4,416party,Ross," (stopping them) Okay, that-thats enough! Yknow, lets,
lets let someone else play."
0,season4,416party,Joey," If you didnt want to play, why did you come to the party?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Okay, my turn!!"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
0,season4,416party,All, Ohh!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Its okay! Its okay! It kicked once, itll kick again!"
0,season4,416party,All, Oh my God!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. "
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Just a bug.
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Yknow it doesnt matter how much Im craving it.
Yknow why Im never gonna eat meat? Because its murder, cold blooded
murder."
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Okay. 
0,season4,416party,Chandler," Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)"
0,season4,416party,Joey," Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, I cant help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
0,season4,416party,Joey," All right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre dating
someone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone really
hot?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Yeah, totally!"
0,season4,416party,Joey," All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youre going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!"
0,season4,416party,Joey, Feel better now?
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, Im
gonna eat like, yknow millions of cows."
0,season4,416party,Joey," Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise."
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, What?
0,season4,416party,Joey," Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Well, suppose until the babys born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-youd just be eating my animals."
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Joey, I cant believe you would do that for me."
0,season4,416party,Joey," Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Theres no meat in beer, right?"
0,season4,416party,Ross," Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away."
0,season4,416party,Emily," But, we cant go now. It looks like Rachels gonna put on a
skit."
0,season4,416party,Monica, Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed."
0,season4,416party,Monica," Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I cant let(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens."
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Hey!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Hi!
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Nice uh, costume."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an E!"
0,season4,416party,All, E!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Gimme an M!
0,season4,416party,All, M!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Gimme an I!
0,season4,416party,All, I!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Gimme an L!
0,season4,416party,All, L!
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Gimme a Y!
0,season4,416party,All, Y!
0,season4,416party,Rachel," What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) EmilWhoa!! (She falls in
Chandlers room.) Okay! So thats me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunthers
the only one that claps.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Im fine! Im fine! Im just losing a tooth, its no
big deal. I have a dentist! Yknow. Im gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?"
0,season4,416party,Monica, I think youre done.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually."
0,season4,416party,Joey, (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," All right, come on, lets go get your coat."
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Okay.
0,season4,416party,Gunther, Rachel is my girlfriend.
0,season4,416party,Joshua," So, this was uh, really fun."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Yknow, this bra
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Yknow, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could
talk, yknow what theyd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isnt co-operating.)"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Need uh, need a little hand there."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control."
0,season4,416party,Joshua, You really dont seem like you do. Thats
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Well, what was supposed to happen?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I dont wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, Im sorry, I thought you needed them!"
0,season4,416party,Joshua," No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted
to see you."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Why?!
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Because I-I like you.
0,season4,416party,Rachel, You like me?
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Yeah! I mean youre-youre beautiful and smart and
sophisticateda lot of this isnt based on tonight."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I cant believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!"
0,season4,416party,Joshua, But
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh no-no-no dont say but! No-no, buts never good! Lets
just leave it at, you like me and I like you."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Okay uh, however"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, now see thats a fancy but."
0,season4,416party,Joshua," My marriage like just ended, and Im really not ready to get
into anything yet."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, But.
0,season4,416party,Joshua," Im sorry, I, I just need a little time."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so
you and Emily are free to go."
0,season4,416party,Ross," Thats okay. Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh, Ross, Im sorry. I completely ruined your evening."
0,season4,416party,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
0,season4,416party,Ross, Helps a little.
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
0,season4,416party,Ross," Yeah, have a seat."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Im so sorry.
0,season4,416party,Ross," Thats okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didnt want it to end this way, yknow?"
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Well, maybe you didnt want it to end?"
0,season4,416party,Ross, What do you mean?
0,season4,416party,Rachel, You seem to really like her.
0,season4,416party,Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment."
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you
dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks."
0,season4,416party,Ross, You think?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
0,season4,416party,Ross," Hey, youre right."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,416party,Ross, Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
0,season4,416party,Rachel," I dont know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
0,season4,416party,Ross," Oh my God! Those werent albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)"
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Hey.
0,season4,416party,Chandler, Hey.
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Youre a pathetic loser, right?"
0,season4,416party,Chandler," Oh-ho, yeah!"
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Sit!
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Hi. (He has just returned.)
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh my gosh, Joshua!"
0,season4,416party,Joshua, All those things I said about not being ready
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Theyre not true?
0,season4,416party,Joshua," No, theyre-theyre all true."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Oh.
0,season4,416party,Joshua, But
0,season4,416party,Rachel," Oh! Oh, I love that but."
0,season4,416party,Rachel, You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
0,season4,416party,Joshua, Yeah.
0,season4,416party,Rachel, Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Oooh, what you got there?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Pastrami.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Yknow what goes good with that?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe," Hm-mm, corn beef."
0,season4,416party,Joey," Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thats much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,416party,Joey," (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Six months.
0,season4,416party,Joey," Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?"
0,season4,416party,Phoebe, Not if I get there first.
0,season4,417porn,Mr. Treeger," Ohhh, man!!"
0,season4,417porn,Joey, (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Treegers snaking the shower drain.
0,season4,417porn,Mr. Treeger, What in the name of hell?
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Maybe he found you flip-flop.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the
remote."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Do we pay for this?
0,season4,417porn,Joey," No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they
punish us."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he
just said.)"
0,season4,417porn,Mr. Treeger," (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds
of naked."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"
0,season4,417porn,Mr. Treeger," Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the
channels and bam! It was like finding money."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Like finding money with naked people on it!
0,season4,417porn,Mr. Treeger," Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back
again. And Im sad. (Exits.)"
0,season4,417porn,Joey, (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this
while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, We dont know what could make this go away.
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, And no one touches the air around the TV!
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Well at least, Im going to mute it."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, We still have porn.
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Hey.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Hi!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Honey, what are you doing? Thats too heavy."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica
right away.)"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Okay.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Ohh, Im getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table. Yknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She
goes over and stands in front of the TV.)"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, You mean like a doctor?
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Pheebs! Youre blocking the porn! Look out!
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Hi.
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Hi.
0,season4,417porn,Ross," So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Oh. Why didnt you take her?
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And yknow, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
0,season4,417porn,Ross, (Thinks about it.) Nah.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Well I, thats the thing, I dont know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) ""This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Lets just enjoy"""
0,season4,417porn,Monica," (interrupting him) No-no-no, dont-dont do the accent.
Youve got to see her again."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, And why do you care so much?
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
0,season4,417porn,Ross, You had fantasies about Emily?
0,season4,417porn,Monica," No! Yknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together."
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Ahh.
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Do you love her?
0,season4,417porn,Ross," We said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, You love her!
0,season4,417porn,Ross, What-what is love really?
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her. Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to
the gate. Youre gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And
shes gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, I am a good kisser.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in (Ross looks at her.) Ive been watching
too much porn."
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Is that the heartbeat?
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor, Thats it.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Oh my God!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Oh wow! This is so cool.
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor, Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Why dont take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
Ill hold onto your card, okay?"
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor," No, Im getting three separate heartbeats."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Three? You guys were worried I wouldnt even have one!
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor, Doctors are wrong all the time.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Well, yeah."
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!"
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor, Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
Im going to have three full grown babies just walkin around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And its gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!"
0,season4,417porn,The Doctor," Actually, giving birth to three babies isnt that different
from giving birth to one."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, What do you know?!
0,season4,417porn,Alice," (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Ooh! Hi!
0,season4,417porn,Alice," Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebes stomach.) So, how did it go at
the doctors?"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Oh well, okay, hey, yknow how when youre umm, youre
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh,
thats nice?"""
0,season4,417porn,Frank, Yes.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Okay, yeah well, good news, youre going to have three babies."
0,season4,417porn,Alice, Three babies?
0,season4,417porn,Frank, I finally got my band!
0,season4,417porn,Alice," Were gonna have a big family, Ive always wanted a big family!"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Oh God, Im so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked."
0,season4,417porn,Frank, Why would we be freaked?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," No, no maybe cause its harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and"
0,season4,417porn,Frank, (Theyre less than happy now) Oh.
0,season4,417porn,Alice, Right.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," No, back to happy. Back to happy!"
0,season4,417porn,Alice," No-no-no, no, its going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach
Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Yknow
itll-itll be like my very own little sweatshop. "
0,season4,417porn,Frank," Yeah, Ive been thinking ever since you said we were having
triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job."
0,season4,417porn,Alice," No, Frank."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, No you cant quit college! No! Youre in college? Really?
0,season4,417porn,Frank," Yeah, refrigerator college."
0,season4,417porn,Alice, Yeah.
0,season4,417porn,Frank," Yeah, yknow when we found out we were going to have a baby,
yknow I figured yknow like I should yknow have like a careerand I
love refrigerators!"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, You cant give up on your dream.
0,season4,417porn,Frank," No, its okay. Were-were gonna have three kids! And
thats-thats a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Emily! (Runs up.)
0,season4,417porn,Emily, Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
0,season4,417porn,Ross," I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
0,season4,417porn,Emily, You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Thats, thats, thats a big candy bar. (Shes holding
one of those huge <i>Toblerone</i> bars.) I had the most amazing time with you."
0,season4,417porn,Emily, Me too.
0,season4,417porn,Emily," Well, that me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him
the candy bar.) Im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the
jetway.)"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,
Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I
think I love you."
0,season4,417porn,Emily, Oh. (Shes shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Thats no problem.
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Its the theme from Good Will Humping.
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Yknow who doesnt even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend
Joshua."
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Yeah right.
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Yes!
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Yeah, he likes porn."
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Where ya going?
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too
skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,417porn,Monica, How did it go with Frank and Alice?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, cause you work for a big company.
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get
you some free white out though."
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
0,season4,417porn,Ross, I did.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," And well, what did she say?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Thank you.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Oh, youre totally welcome! Whatd she say?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she
said, ""Thank you."""
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, What do I do now?
0,season4,417porn,Joey, You play hard to get.
0,season4,417porn,Ross, She already lives in London.
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Then you go to Tokyo.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,
its over."
0,season4,417porn,Monica, It is not over! Youre over!
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, What?
0,season4,417porn,Monica, You know!
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Okay. (Pause) Good one.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you. And the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Okay! Okay! But if she doesnt call, it is definitely over! No, wait.
Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, yknow just to she whats going on, and,
and she says shell call me back, but then she doesnt. Then its
over."
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Way to be strong, man!"
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Hey!
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break. We spent the last two hours watching In &amp; Out &amp; In, Again."
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay."
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, what-what cha got there?"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Oh this, well Im glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a
knife and an soda can.) Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what youre
thinking"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, No!
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Are you sure?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, No!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Whats the second part of your plan?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, My <i>Saturn</i> dealership.
0,season4,417porn,Ross, (Answers the phone.) Hello?
0,season4,417porn,Emily, Ross.
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?"
0,season4,417porn,Emily," It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those
wonderful things."
0,season4,417porn,Ross," No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you
called."
0,season4,417porn,Emily," Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you,
theres-theres someone else."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
0,season4,417porn,Ross," She doesnt know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
0,season4,417porn,Monica," This isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be
another guy."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Well
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Of course theres another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Im not proving anything. Okay, Im done listening to you. If I
hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
wouldve put my fist through the wall!"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, You put your fist through the wall?
0,season4,417porn,Ross," No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, You have to go to London!
0,season4,417porn,Ross, What?
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. Cause you already told her
you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that
theres another guy, so yeah, go to London thatll scare her!"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, I made fun of his accent.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," You sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, No.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Really?
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Dont let her go
without a fight!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," All right. All right, Im gonna do it! "
0,season4,417porn,Monica, All right.
0,season4,417porn,Ross," Im gonna, Im gonna go to London and Im going to fight
for her."
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Okay, good luck!"
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Ross! Ross! If youre going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those <i>Toblerone</i> bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)"
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Hey!
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! Im
gonna open up my own massage place and Franks gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesnt have to quit school!"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, Im telling it! Im telling it!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what Ive got?"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, A place where no one will ever get out alive?
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," No! Think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, its"
0,season4,417porn,Rachel, (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe, The name was my favourite part!
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, well I can up with it!"
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! Thats
not good."
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Well, I"
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Hello.
0,season4,417porn,Ross, (on phone) Hey.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross," No, because she hasnt come home yet. And she hasnt been home
all night! Shes obviously staying with that other guy, and Im the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," All right. When is, when is the next flight out?"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, About four hours.
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show
up by then, then just come on home."
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
thats better than Relaxi Cab."
0,season4,417porn,Rachel," Okay, its not Relaxi Cab. Its Relaxicab, like taxicab. "
0,season4,417porn,Phoebe," Oh, that is better."
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Are we in London?
0,season4,417porn,Monica, What are you doing here? You cant be here!
0,season4,417porn,Emily," Ive uh, Ive come to talk to Ross."
0,season4,417porn,Emily, What?
0,season4,417porn,Joey," (pause) Nothing. No, nothing."
0,season4,417porn,Emily," I was going to call him, but"
0,season4,417porn,Monica," Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I
was right! (Points to Emily) Im right, right?"
0,season4,417porn,Emily, Id really rather talk to him. 
0,season4,417porn,Monica, Oh.
0,season4,417porn,Emily," I uh, Ive been to his apartment and he wasnt there, and uh. I
need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?"
0,season4,417porn,Emily," Ross, are you there? Ross, I dont know if you can hear this
but (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) Im
gonna talk anyway, uh, Im in the States with you sister and your friends and
its all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell youYes,
Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you
that I love you."
0,season4,417porn,Ross," (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all
the way to New York.) I love you too! Im, Im gonna call you right now from the
phone booth! (Realises) You cant hear me. (Goes to make his call.)"
0,season4,417porn,Emily," I wish I could know if youd heard any of that. I suppose Ive
either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if
youre listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose theres
not much chance you did heard that, and theres the call waiting so, I should go. Oh
well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello."
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Hi.
0,season4,417porn,Emily," Ross, I love you!"
0,season4,417porn,Ross, Ohh! Thank you.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Hey.
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Hey.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she
didnt ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
0,season4,417porn,Joey," Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,
gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Noo! Nothing!
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn."
0,season4,417porn,Joey, I think youre right.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," All right, ready?"
0,season4,417porn,Joey, One.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, Two.
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Thats kinda nice.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler," Yeah, thats kinda a relief."
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Yeah.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, You wanna see if we still have it?
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Yeah.
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, FREE PORN!!!
0,season4,417porn,Joey, Yeah!!
0,season4,417porn,Chandler, We have free porn here!!!
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like
a drum."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, its just
Im so pregnant that Imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. So I thought
til Im not, Im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really
cool!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, All right.
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) <i>Smelly cat, smelly
cat, what are they feeding you? </i>"
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," I know! I know, and Ive only been playing for like an hour!"
0,season4,418dress,Alice, (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Hey! What are you doing here?
0,season4,418dress,Alice," Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Oh, well, dont tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my
uterus."
0,season4,418dress,Alice," (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl
baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. "
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Wouldnt that be Frank the III?
0,season4,418dress,Alice," Dont get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three
babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named
the other boy baby."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Wow! Thats so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
0,season4,418dress,Alice, You think about it. (Leaves)
0,season4,418dress,Emily," I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will
think its yours and be horribly traumatised? "
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
0,season4,418dress,Emily," (checks the clock) Ohh, its time to go."
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17
minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
0,season4,418dress,Emily, Well thats ambitious.
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
0,season4,418dress,Emily, Thats Carol with your son!
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Uhh, believe me when hes older, hell understand."
0,season4,418dress,Carol, (knocking on the door) Ross!
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Ill be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,
Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is
Carol and Susan."
0,season4,418dress,Susan," Hey, its so nice to finally meet you!"
0,season4,418dress,Emily, Me too!
0,season4,418dress,Carol," Ohh, yknow, Susans gonna be shooting a commercial in London
next week."
0,season4,418dress,Susan," Oh yeah, Im so excited, Ive never been there."
0,season4,418dress,Emily," Oh, well, Ill show you around."
0,season4,418dress,Susan," That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can
make any suggestions"
0,season4,418dress,Emily," Oh, theres tonnes of terrific stuffIll go with you!"
0,season4,418dress,Susan, Ahh!
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so"
0,season4,418dress,Emily, Are you all right?
0,season4,418dress,Susan," Oh, hes fine. Hes fine. Its just that us getting along
is difficult for him, because he doesnt like me."
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Oh come on! Thats-thats true.
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season4,418dress,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a
book) and found nothing! I want a name thats really like, yknow strong and
confident, yknow? Like-like Exxon. "
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," No, Im-Im not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with ""The."""
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your
buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, theyre hanging out with
Joey."""
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnt think so.) Oh,
come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get
to know him."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, hell be there."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a
little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that youre really hot."
0,season4,418dress,Joey, What do ya say? What do ya say?
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I
dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to
name my kid!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (Shes holding two frilly,
lace nighties.)"
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Yknow what? It really creeps me out choosing other
peoples sex clothes."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Sorry. Im so exited! Ive been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! Im making him a very fancy meal. "
0,season4,418dress,Monica, Um-hmm.
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, What am I making him by the way?
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,
then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Ross," So uh, Emily called last night"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, And now youre giving me the message!
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, theyre
going to the theatre together! Theyre going to dinner! Theyre going horseback
riding!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," God, Susan is so fun!"
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six
months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Hey, theyre going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!
Yknow they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playfuldidnt
you see <i>Personal Best</i>?"
0,season4,418dress,Joey," No, but Im gonna!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Hi! Hi! Youre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
0,season4,418dress,Ross," How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married
her!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Yeah, I definitely. I dont like the name Ross."
0,season4,418dress,Ross, What a weird way to kick me when Im down.
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Oh. Whats wrong with Ross?
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Well, its just yknow that something like this would never to
like The Hulk, yknow"
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Actually that-thats not true, in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> uh, No.
72, Dr. Bruce Banner found (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Yknow,
ugh, nevermind, my girlfriends a lesbian. (Leaves.)"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," So, I decided Im definitely going to go with either Joey or
Chandler."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named
Chandler."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Raymond Chandler.
0,season4,418dress,Joey, Someone you didnt make up!
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey
Buttafucco."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its like
yknow, Chanoey?"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell
never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is
the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely
even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right?
Its a stupid, stupid non-name!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im
sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) "
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Okay.
0,season4,418dress,Joey, So I guess its Joey then!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, (taking a bite) Hmmm!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, Oh my God!
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Oh I know, my God, this is sothis rice is soI am so good."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, Behind you?
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, Im sorry. They used to
live here; sometimes they migrate back over."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way
they can not be here. Its just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Yeah, sure, okay. Okay."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings
them inside.)"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," All gone! So, farm birds, huh?"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Yeah, its-its my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I
wouldve told you about it, but I didnt know they would be here."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Oh.
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," So, all right."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Okay. So, can I serve you a little ofWhat? What? What? (She sees
that Joshua isnt relaxed.)"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Nothing I uh, its just that I know that theyre still out
there."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," But, theyre across the hall! I mean thats two doors away, it
would take them a long time to peck their way back over here."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Okay, thats-thats not funny. Uhh."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Okay, yknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I
mean we could pack all this stuff up and yknow go to your apartment."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Oh, theyre working on this week, its a total mess. But uh,
Im staying at my parents house, we could go there."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Your parents?
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Yeah, theyre out of town."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Ohh.
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Yeah-yeah, its this huge place, and-and its got this
gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Yeah that works.
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, They-they-they can smell fear.
0,season4,418dress,Ross, (opening the door.) Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Carol, Hey! Hows Ben?
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked
him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he
said, ""No."" So, hes sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a
dustpan.)"
0,season4,418dress,Carol," Hey, Ben! Hey!"
0,season4,418dress,Ross," So umm, any word from Susan?"
0,season4,418dress,Carol," Ooh, yeah! She said shes having sooo much fun with Emily."
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
dont know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
0,season4,418dress,Carol, Whats too much fun?
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Yknow, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
0,season4,418dress,Carol," Oh my God, you are so paranoid! "
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Am I?!
0,season4,418dress,Carol, Yes!
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Am I?!
0,season4,418dress,Carol," I cant speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed
relationship."
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Yknow? Say-say theyre
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
theyre laughing, yknow, someone innocently touches someone else
Theres electricity, its new. Its exciting. Are you telling me there
isnt even the slightest possibility of something happening?"
0,season4,418dress,Carol, Maybe.
0,season4,418dress,Ross, OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to
God, that duck pushed me!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Wow! This place is fabulous!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living
room."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Whoa-whoa, theres two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place mustve been a real babe magnet."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Yeah, well, it wouldve been, but uh, my parents just moved here."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Hey, heres an idea. Why dont uh, I put the food in the
fridge and we can eat it later?"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Oh yeah, yeah uh, its down the hall and uh, second door to your
left."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Ah.
0,season4,418dress,Mrs. Burgin," Oh, hi, darling!"
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?"
0,season4,418dress,Mrs. Burgin," Oh, well we cut the trip short."
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin, France sucks!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here."
0,season4,418dress,Mrs. Burgin," Oh, say no more!"
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin," Well just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,
and well be right out of you hair."
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Oh, that-that would be great. So you didnt even get to Italy?"
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin," Yep, sucks!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Hi you!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, Oh my God!
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," I know, I can do more than cook."
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin, I like her. She sees smart.
0,season4,418dress,Joshua," Uhh, Rachel, my parents"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Ohh! Its so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their
hands.) Hello. "
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin, Hi.
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Hello.
0,season4,418dress,Mrs. Burgin," Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
notthats-thats not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually. Its-its, theyre-theyre
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at <i>Bloomingdales</i>, so
And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report
back, ""USA not ready."""
0,season4,418dress,Mrs. Burgin, Maybe in L.A?
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Yes!
0,season4,418dress,Joshua, There you go.
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin," So, have you kids eaten yet?"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next."
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin," Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to
eat?"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin
around the house. "
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin, So We go eat.
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Yes.
0,season4,418dress,Mr. Burgin," Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course,
youll be wearing that."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!"
0,season4,418dress,Joey, Its not that bad.
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
0,season4,418dress,Joey," So, youre just Bing?"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, I have no name.
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
0,season4,418dress,Joey, No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Umm, Gene."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Its Clint. Its Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
0,season4,418dress,Joey," See you later, Gene."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Bye, Gene."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Its Clint! Clint!
0,season4,418dress,Joey, Whats up with Gene?
0,season4,418dress,Monica," So, you wore your nightie to dinner?"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Oh my God!
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Oh, no!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," No, its all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there
heads in agreement.)"
0,season4,418dress,Ross," (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! "
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, So?
0,season4,418dress,Ross, So! Poetry? Susans gay! Theyre being gay together!
0,season4,418dress,Monica, Emilys straight.
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Oh, wake up!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Wow, Carol really messed you up!"
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Excuse me?
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I dont know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right."
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Look, I dont know what youre talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Huh.
0,season4,418dress,Ross, What?
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Shes totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on."
0,season4,418dress,Monica, This totally makes sense!
0,season4,418dress,Ross, It does not!
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werent jealous at all even
though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," All right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then
94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!"
0,season4,418dress,Rachel, Absolutely! Absolutely!
0,season4,418dress,Monica, This is so much fun!
0,season4,418dress,Ross, This is not fun!
0,season4,418dress,Monica," Look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Yeah. The 92 Ross wouldnt.
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
0,season4,418dress,Rachel," Whatyeahwhat, yknow what? I hope Emily is a
lesbian."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Drum roll.
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Youre actually going through with this?
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,
its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson."
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factyes, (To Joey) Im, Im sorry. I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im
gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler."
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, (pleased) Really?!
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Okay. Thanks.
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Okay!
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, You wanna hug it out?
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe, Yay! 
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Yay! 
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Yayohyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Okay!
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Ooh, uh (She grabs her coat and runs out.)"
0,season4,418dress,Chandler," Bye, Pheebs!"
0,season4,418dress,Phoebe," Okay, bye! "
0,season4,418dress,Chandler, Ha! Ha! Ha!
0,season4,418dress,Joey," Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby
Chandler.)"
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Nice luggage.
0,season4,418dress,Carol, I was gonna say
0,season4,418dress,Susan, Hey!
0,season4,418dress,Ross, Hi!
0,season4,418dress,Emily, Hey! I missed you.
0,season4,418dress,Ross," Oh, I missed you too."
0,season4,418dress,Susan," (To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time."
0,season4,418dress,Emily," Oh, so did I."
0,season4,418dress,Ross, (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man," (singing, duh) Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky
is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, HEY!! Do you have to do that? Its Saturday!
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man," Oh come on! Mornings here! (Starts singing)
Mornings here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate
the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Mornings here!
Morning is here"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the
floor!"
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Yknow what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,
I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Im sorry. Im so sorry.
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Okay.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," See, this is a great apartment."
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Shut up! This place is a hole!
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Oh, blimey, I still cant believe youve got an earring!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,
pretending like hes jamming.)"
0,season4,419haste,Emily, He does that?!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Uh, I dont know, whatever."
0,season4,419haste,Emily, I think it makes you look really dangerous.
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Oh, I know. Yknow what, I never wouldve gotten this if it
werent for you. No really, when Im with you Im-Im like this whole
other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love
that guy!"
0,season4,419haste,Emily, I love both of you!
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Yeah?
0,season4,419haste,Emily, I wish I didnt have to go.
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Then dont. Stay here. Just dont go so soon to London, just one
more day."
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Ohh, Ross, please!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," One more day, seriously/"
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Dont do this to me, again. Youd know Id stay here in a
minute, but Id really miss so much work, theyll fire me."
0,season4,419haste,Ross," So, then you can stay as long as you want."
0,season4,419haste,Emily, I wish I could.
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Oh no. Dont, dont, dont start packing. Come on! (She
puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)"
0,season4,419haste,Emily," I dont think you understand packing. Look, I just dont want
to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here."
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on."
0,season4,419haste,Emily, You didnt!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," No. No, I didnt. I didnt want to be that guy."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Ho! Ho! Ho!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Excuse me.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Your pants!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! You like em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and
got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, What?
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesnt get it.) Santa Clauss
pants."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Nuh-uh! Theyre maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby
names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists whos been naughty and whos been
nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)
Ohh."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Monica, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," SoHey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?"
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," I dont know! How are the-the-the-the, yknowYoure
clothes arent funny."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I dont belong here."""
0,season4,419haste,Joey, You have Knicks tickets?
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Yeah, my mom got my dads season tickets in the divorce, so she
just gave them to me."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Yeah, apparently, theyre pretty good seats."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,419haste,Joey, (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Do you guys want these?
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Yeah we do!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Ohh, well you got em."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Just give us our apartment back!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Boy! I didnt see that coming!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Are you serious?
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Oh, come on! We know what these are worth."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Yeah, what, do you think were stupid?"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Youre not stupid. Youre meaner than I thought.
0,season4,419haste,Monica, What do you say?
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Youre bachelor pad?!
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Have you even had a girl up here?
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time."
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Yeah, you do!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Come on!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?"
0,season4,419haste,Gunther, Good one.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up the apartment."
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Oh comelook, when I was a kid my dads company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of
course, he wasnt in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Oh my God!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, We dont make enough fun of you already?
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, You do know that Wham broke up?
0,season4,419haste,Ross," I like it, and Emily likes it, and thats what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Oh-no, dont try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Where is Emily?
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Ugh, shes saying good-bye to her uncle."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Man, didnt she like just get here?"
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Yeah!! Yeah!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Easy tiger.
0,season4,419haste,Ross," I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, ""Well,
Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, So what are you going to do?
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Nothing! Theres nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-shed have to uh, move here. She should move here!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, What?
0,season4,419haste,Ross, I could ask her to live with me!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Are you serious?
0,season4,419haste,Ross," I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Because youve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Ive got
a carton of milk in my fridge Ive had a longer relationship with!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Look guys, when Im with her its-its-its like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yknow?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now."
0,season4,419haste,Joey," All right look, Ross, hes right. Emilys great, shes
great! But this way too soon, youre only gonna scare her!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross, I dont want to do that.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," No! You dont want to wreck it, you dont want to go to fast!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Yeah, no, youre right, I know, youre right, Im not,
Im not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Thats too hard. Too hard!
0,season4,419haste,Monica," (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Or Ill give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, No thank you.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, lets trade! The
timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet! "
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever
read <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>?"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Yes! Didnt you ever read <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?! No! I
didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats."
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Its the Knicks!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Screw the Knicks!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Whoa!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more."
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Huh.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, And the Knicks rule all.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not
an even trade."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Done!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Let me finish. 
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Oh. 
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Im talking about a bet, winner takes all."
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Or you could end up with everything.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Ooh, I like that."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," All right, so what do you say?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, No!
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Oh, just do it!!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Op, op, Im convinced!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Come on man, you know Id do it for you! Because, youre my best
friend."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year.
Im in."
0,season4,419haste,Joey, All right!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because shes
the only whos impartial, and shes so pretty."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Okay. Umm, ooh, oohoh, I have a game!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Okay! 
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Okay!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, This is great!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Whats the game?! Whats the game?!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Oh, well, it doesnt have a nameoh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesnt have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?"
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Theyre green?
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Good! Good! Five points!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," All right, Joey, same question."
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Uhh, theyre tall."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy."
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Thats not even a game!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, What? Shut up! Were winning!
0,season4,419haste,Monica," You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Fine, lets do it."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Oh, I have cards!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Oh.
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Oh, good."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Thats a low one!
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I cant."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Why are you screaming and hugging?
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Because we won our apartment back!
0,season4,419haste,Joey," What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
0,season4,419haste,Monica," No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again."
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Okay.
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Uh-huh, not as high as(picks a card) It worked! King!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Yeah baby!
0,season4,419haste,Monica," But, we pick again! We pick again!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Why?!
0,season4,419haste,Monica, I dont know!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) Thats courtside
baby!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, No they didnt!
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Emily, I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
0,season4,419haste,Ross, (laughs) Move in with me.
0,season4,419haste,Emily, What?!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Dont be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
its too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there."
0,season4,419haste,Ross, I know.
0,season4,419haste,Emily, My job!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Well, so, you-youll get a job here! I mean, Im always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Yeah, but it-it-its my whole lifeyou come to England."
0,season4,419haste,Ross," No, I cant. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
cant leave him. Isntyou dont think theres any way?"
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Ohh, I dont think so. I mean it would be different if it was way
into the future and-and-and we were getting married or something."
0,season4,419haste,Ross, What?
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Oh no, no, right I shouldnt have said married. Uh, please
dont go freaky on me. I didnt mean it. Well, I didnt say it; I take it
back!"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," No, no, dont. Why dont we?"
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Why dont we what?
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Get married.
0,season4,419haste,Emily, You are mad!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," No! No! Im not! Its-its-its perfect! I mean
its better than you just-just moving here, cause its us together
forever, and thats-thats what I want."
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Weve only known each other for six weeks!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, whos-whos to say? Does that me
we-we cant do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesnt it?"
0,season4,419haste,Emily, My parents are going to be really mad.
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Is thatare you saying yes? Is that yes?
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Yes.
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Yes!
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Yes! Were getting married?!
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Oh my God! 
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Yes!
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Were getting married!
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?"
0,season4,419haste,Emily, Yes.
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Ohh, its a bit small."
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
0,season4,419haste,Emily, It was.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Those were like the best seats ever.
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Yknow, kinda
like a peace offering."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and
theyre too small."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)"
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, I KNOW!!!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Open up! Open up! Open up!
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Well discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, What the hell is going on?!
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I dont feel good about it."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," We are switching back, right now!"
0,season4,419haste,Monica," No, were not! Were not leaving!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Well, youre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, were switching it back! Theres nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, I dont know.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, What?
0,season4,419haste,Joey, I dont want to move again! 
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," I dont care, this is our apartment! And they stoleyou
stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. Im getting back right now!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You cant offer anything to us!"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Let us keep the apartment and
0,season4,419haste,Monica," As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute."
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Totally worth it!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, That was one good minute!
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Good night.
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Good night.
0,season4,419haste,Monica, Men are such idiots.
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?"
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Thats so funny to think if youd just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," Yeah, let-let-lets pretend thats not true."
0,season4,419haste,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," Okay, scarfs done. (Its not really a scarf, its just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)"
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Come on! Come on. Come on.
0,season4,419haste,Chandler, Okay!
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,419haste,Monica, What-whats going on?
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
0,season4,419haste,Ross," Uhh, okay, its uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married."
0,season4,419haste,Phoebe," What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!"
0,season4,419haste,Emily," Umm, no."
0,season4,419haste,Monica," When, when didhow, how did you"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," We, we just decided to uh, to go for it."
0,season4,419haste,Emily," I mean, we know its a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,
so"
0,season4,419haste,Ross," (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys"
0,season4,419haste,Rachel," Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachels reaction.) I think its great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, Im so happy for
you!"
0,season4,419haste,Chandler," Oh, well, thats great!"
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Yeah! Yeah!
0,season4,419haste,Monica, (to Ross) I cant believe youre getting married! 
0,season4,419haste,Ross, Yeah. (They hug again.)
0,season4,419haste,Joey," Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)"
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man, (singing) Mornings here! The mornings here! 
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man, Hey! Youre back!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man, (singing) Breakfast is near!
0,season4,419haste,The Singing Man, Ill see you tomorrow morning!
0,season4,419haste,Joey, (happily) Okay!
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!
Joey! Joey!!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to
pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when youre not working here?"
0,season4,420towwd,Gunther, You dont need to fill these silences.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey,
and Phoebe.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Chandler, thats like your fourth cup of coffee!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Im exhausted!
Because Joey started snoring!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Hes in a different room! Hes really that loud?
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (proudly) Oh, you should here me."
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Its not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a
sleep clinic!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," Look, I told ya, Im not going to any clinic! I dont have a
problem, youre the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby
and leave me alone"" clinic!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, They dont have those.
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, youve
just had your first class!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Yknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light
sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," Ohhh, yeah!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Next time you snore, Im rolling ya over!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do
it."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Hey, all right!"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Oh, the Olympics."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Have you guys picked a date yet?
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh no, not yet."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," I still cannot believe youre engaged! (Ross looks at her)
Just cause its happening so fast; not cause youre such a loser. "
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Ugh, shes upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya
something! Im not doing them this time! I dont care if those dishes sit in the
sink until theyre all covered withIll do them when I get home!"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Yeahoh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in
London"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Already?!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Yeah, but it didnt fit. Well, luckily theres a store here that
has one left in her size, but Im the groom, Im not supposed to see the
dress "
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Ill pick it up for you!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Thank you.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Okay.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Oh, shes got you running errands, yknow, picking up
wedding dresses (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Whats wah-pah?
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Yknow, whipped! Wah-pah!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, Thats not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Thats what I did. Wah-pah!
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, You cant do anything!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! "
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Oh! Its you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," So listen uh, I know you and I havent really had a chance to talk
since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Oh.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," I know if you were getting married Id feel, kinda..
yknow."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but
Im okay."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yeah?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," All right, I just wanted to check."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh, thats sweet."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Youre great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You
just hang in there."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh, no, I didnt mean, uh"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," I mean maybe you didnt hear about a serious relationship called me
and Joshua?"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnt
realise that had become anything, yet."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it hasyeah. Oh no, those
were four great dates. "
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Oh. Yeah?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean yknow,
emotionally, mentally, physically"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Wow, thats-thats-thats incredible."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, I know isnt it? Its like Im right there with Joshua.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Uh-huh.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," You are right there with Emily. And its yknow, its
kinda like. its a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, I gotta get to work.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Oh yeah? Fine.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Hey, yknow, yknow what would make me really happy?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh yeah, no, whats that?"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," If like the four of us could all yknow, hang out together. Uh, in
fact Emilys coming into town this weekend, why dont you say we all have
dinner? Say, Sunday night?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, That would be great!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Yeah, all right, its a date. (He leaves)"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the
raspberry.) "
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, (coming back in) Did you say something?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," No, just singing. (Does a little song.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! Its so beautiful!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Yeah, but yknow, about have of these are gonna end up getting
divorced."
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady, May I help you ladies?
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Oh, yes, umm, Im here to pick up a dress that you have on hold."
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady," Yes, whats the name, please?"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Emily Waltham.
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady," Yes! I have it right here. (Phoebe and Monica both gasp at the
dress.) Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, (laughs) Okay.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Youre the most beautiful bride Ive ever seen.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," I am, arent I?"
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady, Ms. Waltham?
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Yes?
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady, Were closing.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
0,season4,420towwd,The Saleslady, And could I get my ring back?
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a
surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a
clinic! Youre going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?
Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.
(Theres a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," No-no, let me in!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Phoebe?
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Can you just hold on for one minute?
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," No, you have to let me in right now!!"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Are you alone?
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Yes!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, All right.
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to
this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Its 6
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," Yeah, well"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and
Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool."
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? Theres nothing to
handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, What?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! I
mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,
one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing
off. Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre
dancing at theres."
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Yeah, well, I dont dance at weddings."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Why not?
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I
look like this (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind
him and he stops.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Hey man.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Nothing.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Nothing.
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, I am (Looks in his date book.) free!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yep!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, In a month?
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yeah!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," You mean, you mean 30 days?"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, From now? 
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well, thats great."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place
that her parents got married, but its going to be torn down, so I mean, I-I
know its crazy, but everything up til now has been so crazy, and I dont
know, this just feels right. Yknow?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (still looking in date book) Hey! Thats the day after I stop
menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isnt mine."
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua," (entering) Hey, Rachel."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Hi!
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, Whats up? Youre voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him)
See you."
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, Great!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, (sitting) You okay?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Im more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, Do I?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are
so on the right track! Yknow? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are
clicking. Yknow?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua," Yeah, sure-sure, yeah,
were-were-were-were-were clicking."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, yknow if-if there was just like one little area where
Ithat I think we needwe would need to work on; I-I would think it was
were just not crazy enough!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua," I-I gotta say, I-I-I-Im not too sure I agree with that."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well, yeah, right, yknow what? Yeah, youre right, I mean, we
no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)I mean, I mean
like craaaazy! Yknow? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound
yknow, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got
married?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, What?! (Gunther is listening in.)
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh, I know, I know, its-its so, its so totally like,
""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Yknow, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!
Dont you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, dont you think?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua," Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, youre a real special lady, but my divorce
isnt final yet and, and, and weve been on four days, so Im thinking
""No, but thanks."""
0,season4,420towwd,Gunther, YOU IDIOT!!!!!
0,season4,420towwd,Sleep Clinic Worker," Your name, please?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, Joey Tribbiani.
0,season4,420towwd,Sleep Clinic Worker," Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for
your sleep study. (Joey doesnt answer) Uh, sir? (Joey starts snoring)"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, (answering for him) Yes he did.
0,season4,420towwd,Sleep Clinic Worker," Alll right, well call you in a few minutes."
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you
doin?"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, What?!
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Youre coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a
stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)
Im Chandler."
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Hi.
0,season4,420towwd,Marjorie, Hi.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, You mind if I
0,season4,420towwd,Marjorie," No, please. "
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," So uh, what are you in for?"
0,season4,420towwd,Marjorie, I talk in my sleep.
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, (asleep) So why dont you give me your number?
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Okay, ready?"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Okay.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Congratulations!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Thank you!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Okay! My turn! My turn!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)
Yeah."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, (upset) That was a terrible throw!!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Im not gonna right to you! Thats not real!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Look at me! My big concern is whats real?! (Finally realises) Oh
my God. Were really sad, arent we?"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Yeah, I think we are."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, This isnt even my dress.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Well, at least you didnt rent yours from a store called,
""Its Not Too Late."""
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Im changing out of this.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Me too.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, In like a half-hour?
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Me too.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Okay, throw it straight this time."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Im getting married next!!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Yay!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," I hate my regular clothes now! Yknow? I look down and-and I
know that this isnt gonna be the most special day of my life."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didnt you start
feeling silly?"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, I guess.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Oh my God! 
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Oh God.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Oh, youre such a cheater!"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, (entering) Hello! Little ones.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (Theyre
stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Oh, howd that happen?"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler, Because Im cooler.
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," No, seriously."
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Well shes, shes the kinda girlJoey was unconscious. "
0,season4,420towwd,Joey, (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! Whats happening?
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, What is that?
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and its gonna
help me not to snore."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? Cause I dont think you
have to wear it unless you are!"
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (takes out the mouth guard) I know I dont have too! It tastes good.
(Puts it back in.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Chandler," Plus, you look cool."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Oh, how did it go?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl
who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, What did he say?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I
feel blue."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that
hes gonna call you again."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care. I dont think
hes the one Im sad about. Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally
okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling
it all that well."
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," Yeah, maybe."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Any luck?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on
again."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica, Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emilys wedding dress into
Rachels room.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,
Ernies at 9 oclock?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh, see I-I dont know if were gonna be hungry at three."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Three people. Joshuas not gonna be there.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, What happened?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Noo. Why?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Well, apparently he scares easy."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross," Oh, Rachel, Im-Im sorry."
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Its okay. Sometimes, things dont work out the way youd
thought they would."
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Come here.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, dont you have to go pick up Emily?"
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, Yeah. 
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,420towwd,Ross, You okay?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Yeah! I got my girls.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebes lap.)
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," (looks at Monica) Hey, yknow what might cheer you up?"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, What?
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Yknow, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)
Maybe someday, there will be."
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," Oh God! Hes gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big
date!"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Monica," No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!"
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe," No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel, Im not gonna marry Chandler!
0,season4,420towwd,Phoebe, Not after this!
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she
does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that its Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the
door.)"
0,season4,420towwd,Joshua, I gotta go.
0,season4,420towwd,Rachel," Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that
oughta do it."
0,season4,420towwd,Joey," (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to
say, ""Whats up with that?"")"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Yknow what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened."
0,season4,421invit,Joey, I know. Ross is getting married.
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Phoebe is, making people."
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Everybodys doing stuff!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
0,season4,421invit,Joey," No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Why not?! I mean its just, its just climbing! Its
just, its just steep!"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Yeah!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Were going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!"
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe, What-whats up?
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Were gonna climb Mt. Everest!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, Yeah baby!
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
yknow you can die. And, you would die!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," (dejected) Yeah, well"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, We could get that Everest video though.
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Yeah, we could do that without yknow risking our lives at all!"
0,season4,421invit,Joey," And while were down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? <i>Die Hard</i>! (Chandlers excited.) Oh, yknow what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order."
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," (dejected) Oh, well"
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe, So you guysll stay here and hang out with me?
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, Yeeeeahhhh.
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Yeah. Yeah.
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," But Ill tell you something. One of these days were get off
of our buts and rent <i>Die Hard</i> again!"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Yeah we are!
0,season4,421invit,Emily, So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)"
0,season4,421invit,Emily," Yeah, theyre fine."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Yeah?
0,season4,421invit,Emily," If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through
the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Sure. Why not?
0,season4,421invit,Emily, Really?
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Yeah?
0,season4,421invit,Emily," I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers
there."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?"
0,season4,421invit,Emily," Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that,
well it might be a awkward for you. But its absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)
More tea?"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Yeah sure.
0,season4,421invit,Emily, Earl Grey?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married
again!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
0,season4,421invit,Monica, Rachel?!
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and
then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
0,season4,421invit,Monica," Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To
Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my
brother Ross? "
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Hi. 
0,season4,421invit,Ross," You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a,
um, major crush on you."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, I knew.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, I did.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Yeah, maybe..."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
0,season4,421invit,Ross,"  See, I see.... big passion in your future."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Really?
0,season4,421invit,Ross, I do.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, It's never gonna happen.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yes, yes, that's right..."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]
Look at it!"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! "
0,season4,421invit,Ross," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, (hurt) What?
0,season4,421invit,Ross, I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy
for me to see you with Julie?"
0,season4,421invit,Ross," The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm
with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Fine.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Good.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Good. (Ross leaves)
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life Im doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life Im doing
something that Im actually good at. I mean. if you dont get that..."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And Im happy for ya,
but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
dont know what to do anymore."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Well neither do I!
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Is this about Mark?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Okay, its not, its not."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, youre, youre, youre making this too hard."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Oh Im, Im making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," I dont know, I dont know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Okay, okay, fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a
break, (goes to the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
0,season4,421invit,Chloe, Do I know why were rushing?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(Hes frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! "
0,season4,421invit,Chloe, Thats so great for you guys!
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Yeah! 
0,season4,421invit,Chloe," Good luck, with your girlfriend. "
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yes, you can, very much."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! "
0,season4,421invit,Ross, No!!
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
0,season4,421invit,Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, Uh-oh.
0,season4,421invit,Ross, What?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Was she good?
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Dont answer that.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk
about it!! How was she?"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, She was...
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Awful! Horrible!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
0,season4,421invit,Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," She, she was different."
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Ewwwww!
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, Uh-oh.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Good different?
0,season4,421invit,Ross, Nobody likes change.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel,"  ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much
youve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.  Ooh, I just wish we
hadnt lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little
perspective..."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, You seem to really like her.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you
dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks."
0,season4,421invit,Ross, You think?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Hey, youre right."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,421invit,Monica," Ohh, this is soo amazing! I cant believe my brothers getting
married! And in London! Its so romantic!"
0,season4,421invit,Joey," (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! Youre
at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my
invitation."""
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," Oooh look! Isnt this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, (entering) Hello!
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,421invit,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Rosss wedding?"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, (sarcastic) Noo.
0,season4,421invit,Joey," Dont worry man, I get to bring a guest. Well show him."
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," Im so jealous youre all going! I cant believe I never
knew that you cant fly in your third trimester!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, I didnt know that.
0,season4,421invit,Monica, I never knew that either.
0,season4,421invit,Joey," I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didnt know that, but you
should see your faces."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, (entering) Hey guys! Whats up?
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
0,season4,421invit,Monica, Were hanging out.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Whats this? Is this Rosss wedding invitation?
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," See, maybe thats the one we shouldve actually hidden."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you dont have to do that! Im
happy for him! I am! I reallyIm-Im happIll work on it."
0,season4,421invit,Monica, Im sorry honey.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season4,421invit,Monica," Rach, youre gonna come though arent you?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh, honey, I dont know. I"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," This isnt one of those uh, yknow ""If she doesnt
come, we-we dont, we dont come?"" Right? Because I already bought my
ticket"
0,season4,421invit,Monica," You know what would be real weird? Is if you werent there. Just
say youll think about it, okay?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," No, Ill think about it. Yeah."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Who's this from?
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Oh, that's Ross's. "
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe, Remembered what?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I
was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
0,season4,421invit,Monica, I can't believe he did this.
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, What did you just say?
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Oh.... my God.
0,season4,421invit,Rachel,  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. "
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-
you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up
either. "
0,season4,421invit,Rachel,  She didn't hang up either...
0,season4,421invit,Ross,"  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y(Rachel grabs the phone
and hangs it up for him.)"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,
everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your <strong>cat</strong>...(cut)...I
am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up
and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)"
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Rach, I got a message from you."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone
Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and
lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression
on his face.)"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, You're over me?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Ohh, ohh."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," When, when were you... under me?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," OK, I need to lie down. "
0,season4,421invit,Joey," He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Really?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Really. It's always been you, Rach."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh, god."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
0,season4,421invit,Gunther, Im sorry. Was I not supposed to?
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
0,season4,421invit,Ross, You still love me?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Noo.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Noo! Maybe! I, I dont know. "
0,season4,421invit,Ross, What?!
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," I just, I feel, I-I just..."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Y'know I cant believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!"
0,season4,421invit,Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)"
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
0,season4,421invit,Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
0,season4,421invit,Monica," You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
0,season4,421invit,Rachel, Oh.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off."
0,season4,421invit,Ross," OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright."
0,season4,421invit,Monica, (to Ross) I can't believe you did that.
0,season4,421invit,Ross," Yeah, well."
0,season4,421invit,Phoebe," See, he's her lobster."
0,season4,421invit,Monica, (seeing the decision) Nooooo. Youre really not going?
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," Yeah. Its just gonna be too hard. Yknow? I mean, its
Ross. How can I watch him get married? Yknow its just, its for the best,
yknow it is, its Yknow, plus, somebodys got to stay here
with Phoebe! Yknow shes gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour."
0,season4,421invit,Monica, You dont have a car. And your license expired. 
0,season4,421invit,Rachel," I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, theres so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in."
0,season4,421invit,Chandler," All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) ""Its almost as good as being there."""
0,season4,421invit,Joey, Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," (angrily) Thats like the tenth time Ive peed since Ive
been here!"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Thats also like the tenth time you told us.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Yeah, oh Im sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya,
its a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk
on your bladder! Im so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a
cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, causeOh! Im pregnant!"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Pheebs, didyou want a cookie?"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, (starting to cry) Thank you so much.
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, I havent really had any yet.
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Hey guys!
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Hey.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," All right, heres the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans
on giving Emily) "
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning
bachelor parties, dont you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Oh, its awkward. Its awkward. Its awkward."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, I sortve already asked Chandler.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Joey, I figured youd understand. I mean, I-Ive known him a lot
longer."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Come on Ross! Look, I-I dont have any brothers; Ill never get
to be a best man!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, You can be the best man when I get married.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, (pause) Ill never get to be a best man!
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never
get to be yours at all?"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, youyeah, of course you get to be my best man."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you
just said I could!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for
science fiction writers!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, I cant believe youre not picking me.
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Im not even Im not even
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to
be my best man."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, (to her babies) Stop it!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, What?
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, One of the babies is kicking.
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, I thought that was a good thing.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Its not kicking me, its kicking one of the other babies. Oh
(looks down her dress)! Dont make me come in there!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Yeah, theres one right under the cabinet. "
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, (grabs it) Thanks.
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Why do you need it?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, were having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the
door.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Hormones!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come youre having a party
and were not invited?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, its Rosss bachelor party."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Sooo?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Are you bachelors?
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Nooo!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Are you strippers?
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Nooo!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Then youre not invited. (Starts for the door again.)
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," All right fine! Youre not invited to the party were gonna
have either."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh-whoa, what party?"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Well umm
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, The baby shower for Phoebe!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I dont want to do!
Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," I cant believe Im gonna have a party! This is so great!
(Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and
Rachel moves to comfort her.) I dont know why."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a
lot of liquor."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Great. Great.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and
Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking
about this pretty loud."
0,season4,422wbme,Gunther, Ill be there.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," All rightoh! Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really
like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only
the dinosaur dudes!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Okay! Well need a six-pack of <i>Zima</i>.
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Yeah, see, I dont think its gonna that difficult considering
this one wont be taking place in the basement of a <i>Pizza Hut</i>."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Oh, Im Ross. Im Ross. Im too good for the Hut;
Im too good for the Hut."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just
remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing
poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, You got it.
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Okay, see ya later."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)
Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Well, theres gonna be strippers there. He didnt say anything
about no strippers."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," He just said, ""No strippers."""
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, I chose not to hear that."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel
what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the
babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Little village people.
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (Its a little pink
and white dress for the girl baby.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Oh, that is so sweet!"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after
shes done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Oh, shes gonna love that!"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me
feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! This sucks!
All right, whats my next present?!"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Hey listen man, about the stripper"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Yeah?
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Good call!
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement,
a little announcement. Ive decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!"
0,season4,422wbme,Gunther, Whats my last name?
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Central Perk?
0,season4,422wbme,Gunther, (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther dont-dont forget your shirt. (He gives
Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Hey-hey, what are those?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, little party favours, check it out! (Its a shirt that reads,
""Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998"")"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Wow! Yeah!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh-oh! (Shows him whats on the back, ""Best Man Joey Tribbiani,
with a huge picture of him.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I
just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the
stripper) so is the position of the bride."
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper, Great!
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and
runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, hey, dont forget your shirt."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Okay, hey, museum geeks, partys over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice
lady. There you go. Back to your parents basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit
and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!
Here you go. All right."
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Yeah!
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Wow, I didnt know they let you keep chickens and ducks as
pets."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)"
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw
one hell of a party."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin ya. And listen if any of my
friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday"
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around."
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper, Yeah?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Yeah. Ill let you play with my duck.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Hey, (realises he doesnt know her name.) stripper! (He notices that
the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees its empty and starts to panic.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," (running and banging on Chandlers door) The stripper stole the
ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper
stole the ring!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, (opening the door) What?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, The ring is gone!
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring! Youre the worst best man ever!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Dude, this isnt funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,
everythings cool! I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is
gone!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, You slept with the stripper?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Of course!! (Shrugs.)
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Hi, guys."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebes way.)
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Hi Phoebe.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy
yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, No we
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Hormones.
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," hormones, yeah."
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. Thats great. So how-how
are things going?"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Good. Yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels like
everythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you?"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Rosss wedding."
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, Oh!
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," It just might be too hard, given the history and all that"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Well, h-how is this like that?"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Well, lets see, its not. Really, like that. Because, you see
that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch of
yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," (starting to cry) Im-Im sorry, I just thought that"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Ugh! I dont know what Im going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they dont care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isnt an emergency, then what is?"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Hey!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Hey
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast. Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Yeah, right!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," So you might say, its a magic ring."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why
dont you be my best man."""
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-Im gonna call the
cops!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Dude, I screwed up, you dont have to turn me in!"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Not on you! On the stripper!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyre gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Okay, well, well call the company that sent her!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," I did that too! They wouldnt give me her real name or her number.
They said, ""If I bothered them again theyd call the police."" I said,
""If you talk to the police, you tell them Im missing a ring!"""
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That theres
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!!"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Heres your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a
step back.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," (sips it) Its so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of
relief.) Oh, thanks."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Good.
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Im so glad you liked it.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, What?!
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, You what?
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Wait, you cant have the baby here! I mean I havent
sterilised it since the guys moved out!"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Okay. Its okay. Were gonna be okay. Yknow what?
Its okay. Im gonna, Im gonna, Im gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," No. Its all right; its probably false labour. They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Rachel, get the book! The book!"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, The Bible?!
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, I dont know!
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would
she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill
be uh, Mr. Wong."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Diverse.
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper, Did anybody call for security?
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)"
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)
Hey, Joey?"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Way to be cool, man."
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper, Whats he talking about?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
0,season4,422wbme,The Stripper," Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I dont need to
steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys
make that?"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," I dont get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didnt
take it, and I didnt take it; and you (Chandler) didnt take it, then who did?
(The duck quacks.) Shh! Were trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesnt get it. After a short pause, with the duck
still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, I still dont get how you know when its false labour.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Well, do you see any babies?"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, How do you feel?
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Okay, I guess. I mean I dont know, its just, I guess I
know its going to be over soon."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," Well, isnt that a good thing? You said you were sick of this."
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," I know. Its just yknow usually when youre, when
youre done with the pregnant thing, yknow, then you get to do the mom thing.
Im gonna be yknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Some moms do that.
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Okay thats even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, its just that now that theyre in me its like, its like I
know them yknow, I mean-I mean, its just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away."
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have
anything. Youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even
better."
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Yeah, okay."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," No, really. Really, Pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just wont calm down. Yknow?"
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," I mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Yeah.
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel," And yknow what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, They are gonna love me.
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, Oh!
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Again.
0,season4,422wbme,Monica," Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, Youre the best. Thanks. Oh! 
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe, Just kidding. Ahh!
0,season4,422wbme,Rachel, What?!
0,season4,422wbme,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season4,422wbme,Phoebe," Got cha again, you guys are so easy."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, If anything should happen to him
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Joey! The vet said its a simple procedure.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," So! Things can go wrong! You dont know! What if he doesnt make
it?!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," He will, Joe."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Yeah, but what if he doesnt? Hes such a good duck."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Im so worried about him, yknow?"
0,season4,422wbme,The Doctor, (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,
and then does a double-take realising where its been.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, H-h-h-hows the duck?
0,season4,422wbme,The Doctor," Hes doing just fine, hes resting now, but you can see
him in a little bit."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," No, thats all right."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," No, its not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let
you down!"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," Hey, come on, its not your fault."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Yeah, it is! You wouldnt have lost the ring, right? Yknow
what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man."
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler," No, you should."
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," Now, dont argue with me"
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you
guys. "
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Really?
0,season4,422wbme,Joey, Really?
0,season4,422wbme,Ross," Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are
my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good (They all start getting
emotional.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, Thanks man.
0,season4,422wbme,Joey," (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so
that they cant see him cry.)"
0,season4,422wbme,Chandler, What a baby.
0,season4,422wbme,Ross, Total wuss!
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to
get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Six-hour trip to London. Thats a lot of Monica.
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
check! Travellers cheques, check! "
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Who are you saying ""check"" too?"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Myself. Yknow for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good
thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only
did it the one time. But it was pretty weird."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Hey! Are you ready yet?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Yep! You got the tickets?
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Oh! Got em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Its all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls apartment.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, You got your passport?
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You dont want to lose that."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, There it is.
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand
side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask
her this stuff?"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Yeah, okay, give that a try!"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," (entering, with Joey) All right! Lets do it!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Woo-hoo!!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Yeah, cheerie-o! "
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, London baby!
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Okay, cause thats not gonna get annoying."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, (louder) London baby!!
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Hey, yknow what? I was wrong."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Well, were all here! I guess we should get going!"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on
your wedding, but I dontcant get up."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Oh, Ill-Ill come hug you."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh, have a great wedding!"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Thanks.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Hey! (Trots over)
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, its on the
counter in your apartment."
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebes book as Rachel comes in from her
room.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," (to Rachel) So, were off."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Have fun!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I cant believe youre not gonna be
there!"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Oh, I know."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, So-so come! Why dont you come?
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, What?!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, To London! Come to London. Please? Itll mean so much to me.
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Yeah, well, I gotta work, Im sorry."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Why-why cant you take a couple of days off?
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Because, I cant! Ross, I told you, no. I cant."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, This is my wedding.
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go!
Lets go! Lets go!!"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," (entering, with Phoebes book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go
Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, (laughs) Thank you.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," All right, lets go! Bye, Pheebs!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Bye, Pheebs!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh, do you need a hug? You dont have to bring me anything!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Come on! Do something!
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," I am, Im ignoring you."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All
right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of
London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Oh, what the hell is that?"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Its London, baby! All right, the hotels here. (Points to the
map.) Wait. No, we wanna go No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Im gonna have to
go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Okay. Listen-listen, were not gonna have to walk this way the
entire time are we?"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," and that was all before 10 oclock. The caterer rang and said
it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned
to say there arent any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
Were not gonna be"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," Well, up yours too!"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, What?! No! No! Thats-thats time-out!
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Sorry.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everythings gonna be great, okay? Come on.
Come on."
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Chicken Kiev?
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Um-hmm! Doesnt that sound delicious at the last minute?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Yeah, yknow, but something like salmon which would be so much more
elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross
pushes her.) So, I cant wait to see this place youre getting married!"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emilys parents got married
here."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," I still cant believe theyre tearing it down. It really is the
most lovely building youll ever see. I mean its over (She stops
suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Its nice.
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What
are we going to do?"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Its all right! Everythings gonna be all right.
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Hows it gonna be all right?!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Uh-huh, I see that."
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out
what happened. "
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, What? What?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, They torn it down a few days early.
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,
Chandler?"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre
thinking of changing the name of this place."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Really? To what?
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, To Put the Camera Away!!!
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler
towards the Abbey.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Oh, honey! Dont get up! What do you need?"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Okay, I have a wedgie."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Okay, that is all you."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Oh, I dont know. I guess we have to eat."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yeah, I do. Whats the matter?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Im just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I
shouldnt have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Eh, dont be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love
with was getting married"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, (interrupting) Still in love with?! 
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Im not in love with Ross!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Phoebe, Im going to Rosss wedding because he is my
ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, Im still in
love with him! I mean, hey, yknow, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yknow?
Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings dont mean love! I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
that doesnt mean that-that Im still in love with him. Yknow? I-I have
sexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh! Oh my God! Oh mywhy
didnt you tell me?!!"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, We thought you knew!
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, We?!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, You all know? Does Ross know?
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Oh no, Ross doesnt know anything."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Oh, I can not believe you didnt tell me!"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that
would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,The Vendor," So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves,
tulip post cards..."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on
the front of it.) Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Well, I dont have to buy that, ""Im with stupid""
T-shirt anymore."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you?
Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Oh, I embarrass you? "
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
0,season4,423rowed,The Vendor," Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear
them!"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
0,season4,423rowed,The Vendor, (looks around) Theyre all tourists.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If youre gonna make me choose between
you and the hat? I choose the hat."
0,season4,423rowed,The Vendor, Good choice.
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Thanks.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I
am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand
and walks away trying to be cool.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Hello?
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
well be able to find a new place for the wedding."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, We dont have to.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, She said what?
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," She said, ""If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere
that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts
his pants on backwards.) This isnt right."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure
theyll come back when we can do it right."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
(Holds out his pants)"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," Dont you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We
have no choice! Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross
dont you understand? This is our wedding Im talking about."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is
when were getting married."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, So what are you saying? Its now or never?
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," No. Im saying its now. (He starts putting on his pants,
backwards again.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Or?
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," Its not the pants. Its you that is backwards. And if, and if
you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we
shouldnt get married at all! (She storms out.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please(He catches something important in the
zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, (depressed) Hi.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Manhattan does not have enough stores.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Well, I think I can help you get over him."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, You can?
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Um-hmm.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, And a small piece of chocolate.
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,
the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnt feel like getting up. Okay,
Im gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youre going to remember all of
the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think hes such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs
it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youre with Ross
okay and imagine that youre kissing him. And youre-youre running your
hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
its some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, lets try
some uh, aversion therapy."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Okay?
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, All right.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," So uh, now look at the picture"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Okay.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," All right, and umm (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the
head.) "
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Ow!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Okay, how do you feel now?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Well, I like you less!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Hey.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that you
were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool. And if it makes you feel any
better, Ive had a really lousy day."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Me too.
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Noo!! Ive had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, (entering) Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
"
0,season4,423rowed,Fergie," (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, whats your
friends name?"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," (on tape) Oh, Chandler."
0,season4,423rowed,Fergie, Hi Chandler! (Waves) 
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Thats Thats was
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Thats Fergie baby!!
0,season4,423rowed,Fergie," Joey says you dont really like his hat, but I think its
kinda dashing."
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, How did you? How? How?
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So, Im in my map and-and(Ross enters) Hey!"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Hey!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Umm
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, Im gonna go to the bathroom.
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Hey-hey, since youre the fix-it lady, heres a
pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnt want to have the wedding at
all?"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, She said that?!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Yeah.
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Why?!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," I dont know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Oh my God. Youre even dumber than I am!
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Excuse me?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, I dont know. A month?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what we
did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets
thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most
important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
other stuff was."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
just doing the flying nun."
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Sometimes we were.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Okay.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross, Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, That was pretty intense huh?
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didnt think that we just went in
there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler, (glares at him) I hope he did!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Hello.
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! Its Joey!"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on thethat looks just
like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say hi! but then I
figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Ohh, theyre having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!
Aunt Rachel hasnt been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Kinda, but Ive just been having way too much fun."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, So youre not homesick yet?
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," No, I dont think so."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," All right, the seven of us miss you."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Whos seven?
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yknow, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Ahh, the babies miss me?"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Ooh, the pizza guys here!"
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, What? You ordered pizza without me?!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yeah. But yknow we were thinking about you, yknow we ordered
the Joey Special."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey, Two pizzas?!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
0,season4,423rowed,Joey," Wait, well, where did you get it from?! "
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Youll see.
0,season4,423rowed,Emily," I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Oh God.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer
bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles"
0,season4,423rowed,Monica," And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little
alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and (Points to Ross) You
go."
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place
at any other time. Really, its fine, whatever you want."
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Its perfect.
0,season4,423rowed,Ross," And, I dont know, if it starts to rain"
0,season4,423rowed,Emily, Well then well get wet. (They kiss.)
0,season4,423rowed,Monica, Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Pheebs?
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Yeah?
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, Do you remember where the duck food is?
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, (enters with a bag packed) Because Im going to London.
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
dont have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) "
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!"
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," Thats not why youre going! Youre going because you
hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British
chippy."""
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel, OhhDo you think he will?!
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," No! Because hes in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yknow,
its too late! You missed youre chance! Im sorry, I know this must be
really hard, its over."
0,season4,423rowed,Rachel," Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, ""I
do."" (Exits)"
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe," I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesnt
stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter."
0,season4,423rowed,Phoebe, Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emilys Parents house.
0,season4,423rowed,Housekeeper," Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and its not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye."
0,season4,423rowed,Chandler," Joey, its been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,
Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
