0,season3,301plf,Joey, I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
0,season3,301plf,All," Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is
occupied by strangers)."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Huh. (They all leave, dejected)"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, I have to say <em>Tupolo Honey</em> by Van Morrison.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is <em>The Way We Were</em>.
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on <em>Who's
The Boss</em>."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," What song was that, Pheebs?"
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," (singing) <em>Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za</em>."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe, Hi Monica!
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Hey Mon!
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Hey Mon!
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Nope.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," No, it's been three nights in a row."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of
Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I
could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a
opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the
phone call."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Morning.
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man
to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey."
0,season3,301plf,Joey, (sarcastically) Good morning.
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from
work today and just hang out with me."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go
see my lawyer. "
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting
divorced. I'm such a grown up."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
0,season3,301plf,Joey, (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
0,season3,301plf,Janice," I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
0,season3,301plf,Joey, B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Nope, not this time."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Come on, quite yankin' me."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, I'm not yanking you.
0,season3,301plf,Joey, This is Janice.
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,
that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at
each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," God, look what I found in the drain."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, What?!
0,season3,301plf,Monica," It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with
this?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Getting it away from me would be job one.
0,season3,301plf,Monica," It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this
is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)"
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your
cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down
the drain.)"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," God, what is wrong with me."
0,season3,301plf,Ross, You need to get some sleep.
0,season3,301plf,Monica, I need to get some Richard.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of
wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Maybe, because you told him not to."
0,season3,301plf,Monica, What are you the memory woman?
0,season3,301plf,Joey," (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking
up. He didn't blink or anything."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,
they're really cute."
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his
girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All
right who's first? Huh? Ross?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,
so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering...."
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Hmm?
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Hmm.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Well honey, what about you?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, What?
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, No.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Come on you gotta have one!
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Nope.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Ross, you know what..."
0,season3,301plf,Ross, What?
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," ...if you tell me, I might do it."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, <em>Return Of The Jedi</em>?"
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as
his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. "
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Oooh!
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty
cool."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved
that."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Really!
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she
stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!"
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Really! That-that great huh?
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe, No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
0,season3,301plf,Ross, (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Hi you guys!
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a
parking meter."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Mon. Hi! 
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Hi.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Why aren't you at work?
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Oh, they-they sent me home."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Why?
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
0,season3,301plf,Monica, I know I do.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Hi.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Guess what?
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, What?
0,season3,301plf,Ross, They published my paper.
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look
like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
(Ross stands up horrified) There he is."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Wheel!
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Of!
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got
three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," No, Janice."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go
together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a
problem with Janice?"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler
follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the
Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Well, there you go."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you
nuts before too, remember?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.
Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Look, what do you want me to say?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, I want you to say that you like her!
0,season3,301plf,Joey," I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts
laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have
something to throw at her. "
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by
the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, How could you have told her? 
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other
everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that
locker room stuff."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who
did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Were both of those Joey?
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your
girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Not even with your best friend.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Noo!
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding
and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same
thing you are."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
0,season3,301plf,Rachel, Pretty much.
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the
night of five times? "
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the
plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me
your happy place."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Richard's living room, drinking wine."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And
get out!"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to
ask that you don't move anything."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," All right, I'll try not to."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the
warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not
permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and
the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," So, I hear, you hate me!"
0,season3,301plf,Joey," I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off
and throw it at me."
0,season3,301plf,Joey, And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
0,season3,301plf,Janice," All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about
our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea"
0,season3,301plf,Joey, But what does that gonna do...
0,season3,301plf,Janice, For Chandler!
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Okay. I'm in.
0,season3,301plf,Janice, Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Does it have to be a whole day?
0,season3,301plf,Janice," Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War."
0,season3,301plf,Phoebe," Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,
and Phoebe leave)"
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Umm, yeah."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,
stamina, girth...."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? "
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing
it. Do you wanna?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Nooo!
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Yeah, okay."
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Yeah?
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Yeah! All right! You go first.
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Okay, okay, I'll go first."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Okay.
0,season3,301plf,Ross," So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,
and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Yes! 
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, I know!
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Okay.
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
0,season3,301plf,Ross, Hmph.
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these
like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the
Xerox place...."
0,season3,301plf,Ross," With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And
your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't
possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's
kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the
matter with you?"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, You said...
0,season3,301plf,Ross," I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler
goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down)."
0,season3,301plf,Janice, We're baack!
0,season3,301plf,Joey, Hey!
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, What are you guys doing together?
0,season3,301plf,Janice, Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Really.
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I
love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
0,season3,301plf,Janice," I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)"
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, You still can't stand her can you?
0,season3,301plf,Joey," I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea
Stadium."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler," Well, I guess that's something."
0,season3,301plf,Joey," No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means
I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Okay.
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into
Ross."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Oh God!
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
0,season3,301plf,Chandler, Really?
0,season3,301plf,Joey," Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come
into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you
really doing here Dad?"
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
0,season3,301plf,Monica, What makes you think that I might not be okay?
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller, I saw Richard.
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Oh.
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," So, how are you doing?"
0,season3,301plf,Monica," I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller, You don't wanna know.
0,season3,301plf,Monica," No, I really, really do."
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," Well, he's doing terrible!"
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Really!
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller, Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
0,season3,301plf,Monica, You're not just saying that are you?
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," No, the man is a mess."
0,season3,301plf,Monica, Was he crying?
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller, No.
0,season3,301plf,Monica," Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller, Maybe.
0,season3,301plf,Monica, I think so.
0,season3,301plf,Mr. Geller," Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know
after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,
wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's
nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns
around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks
up the cigar, and starts watching the video)"
0,season3,301plf,Rachel," Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look
on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?
Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom
standing where Rachel is)"
0,season3,301plf,Ross," I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around
and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)"
0,season3,303jam,"<br/>
[Scene"," Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in
Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.]"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, (from bedroom) WHOAA!!
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not
to jump on the bed."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this
morning."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, I didn't know there were docks.
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Aww, is it broken?"
0,season3,303jam,Joey," No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is
wearing)"
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it
just *fell* out of the socket."
0,season3,303jam,Joey, What is this? Fruit?
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Monica's making jam.
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at
our place?"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Because the kids need new shoes.
0,season3,303jam,Monica," I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed
about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?
Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey
realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, This will just be my batch.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have
you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
0,season3,303jam,Guy," You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters...."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,303jam,Guy," One more chance Ursula, please?"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. "
0,season3,303jam,Guy, Wh..
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
0,season3,303jam,Guy," Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, you're not a dingus."
0,season3,303jam,Guy," I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet
your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is
just what, what she does to guys, okay."
0,season3,303jam,Guy, Well thanks. (starts to leave)
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in
Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was
this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He
said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
0,season3,303jam,Guy, Not really.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice
guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
0,season3,303jam,Guy," Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice.
Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
0,season3,303jam,Guy," Yeah, okay."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't
have to walk behind me any more."
0,season3,303jam,Guy, Sorry.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Mon?
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Mon?
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Wait a minute, look."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, What?
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Look, look, look."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," What, what, what?"
0,season3,303jam,Ross, It's an empty apartment.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Oooh.
0,season3,303jam,Ross, We're all alone in an empty apartment.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts
kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
(they fall onto the couch)"
0,season3,303jam,Ross, There it is.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Do I look fat?
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that
to mean that I was calling her a cow. "
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her...."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's
just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Nooo!
0,season3,303jam,Ross, And it works both ways.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," That's easy, baggage claim."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Oh.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, All right are you guys gonna come down?
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Good luck Chandler.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Thank you Rachel.
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Bye sweetie.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Bye hon.
0,season3,303jam,Ross," (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but
there is something you can do."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.
Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and
thigh.) Okay, you're in bed..."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
0,season3,303jam,Ross, I'm gonna use the cushion.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for
her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back
over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, the old hug and roll."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Yep.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Okay, one question."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Shoot.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the
movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?"
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, (Looks at him) You're so pretty.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, (entering) Hi!
0,season3,303jam,All," Hey, Phoebe."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him
today."
0,season3,303jam,Joey, (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his
name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was
Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause
of the restraining order."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this
very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you
know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you
know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with
crumbs) "
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
0,season3,303jam,Monica, (entering) Hey guys.
0,season3,303jam,All, Hey Mon.
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin."
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds
up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Put your hands together.
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch."
0,season3,303jam,Joey, No more jam?!
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
0,season3,303jam,Monica," I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, What are you talking about?
0,season3,303jam,Monica, I'm talking about me having a baby.
0,season3,303jam,Ross, What?
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Are you serious?
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my
life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's
when I came up with the baby plan. "
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!"
0,season3,303jam,Monica," It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," That, that's what's stupid."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And
there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Down at the docks again?
0,season3,303jam,Janice, Night-night Bing-a-ling.
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self)<i> 'Look at
all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird
though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!
Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,
time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!
And 1...2...3!'</i> (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)"
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, Here's my binoculars.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going
strong. Keep going."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)"
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here
something from it?"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Um, not even a little bit."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, It's about you.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, okay then."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm
such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird,
but kinda cool."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, Good. So what were you thinking?
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, Really?
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, No.
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, okay. (he kisses her)"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on
down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, You mean there's more than one of us.
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna....."
0,season3,303jam,Monica, You're gonna what?
0,season3,303jam,Ross, I'm gonna tell Mom.
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, Crazy.
0,season3,303jam,Monica," What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to
something...."
0,season3,303jam,Ross," (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so
ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Check it out!! Jam crackers!
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,
born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn
and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments"
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Joey, this is you!"
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, When did you go to a sperm bank?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,
Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, And that's how you bought it?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised
there's any of my boys left."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket
scientist here."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'
on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, (entering) Hellooo!
0,season3,303jam,All, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Ross, How's the maniac?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He
quit for me."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how
long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
0,season3,303jam,Ross, You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following
her?"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler," Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, What are you saying I should do?
0,season3,303jam,Monica," I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Thank you, Monica."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)"
0,season3,303jam,Janice," Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!"
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
0,season3,303jam,Janice," Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll
thing. "
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?"
0,season3,303jam,Janice," You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh...
my....God."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, Phoebe?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe, Yes? Yes! Oh.
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, What are you doing?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.
Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)"
0,season3,303jam,Malcom, Were you following me?
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks
past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)"
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just
walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you
know she takes this train?"
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I
made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause
your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be
like an Ursula patch."
0,season3,303jam,Malcom," Uh-huh, I don't know."
0,season3,303jam,Phoebe," Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the
pillar, which way am I gonna go? "
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Hey.
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Where you going?
0,season3,303jam,Monica, To the bank.
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Sperm or regular?
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Sperm.
0,season3,303jam,Joey," So you're really doing this, huh?"
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. "
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Sounds nice.
0,season3,303jam,Monica," 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," No kiddin', hmm. "
0,season3,303jam,Monica, What?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Really? Why?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,
smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Hoyt?
0,season3,303jam,Joey," It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big
pool."
0,season3,303jam,Monica," Really, is he a swimmer?"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, He's got the body for it.
0,season3,303jam,Monica, I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
0,season3,303jam,Joey, You guys have one of those signs that says
0,season3,303jam,Monica, We do not have one of those signs.
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great
kids."
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Two girls and a boy?
0,season3,303jam,Joey, Yeah!
0,season3,303jam,Monica," And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,
they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of
them."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good
too. "
0,season3,303jam,Monica, Yeah.
0,season3,303jam,Joey," Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops
hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for
like a day. (hugs her again)."
0,season3,303jam,Joey," I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of
Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of
the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if
they met me in person."
0,season3,303jam,Rachel," Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)"
0,season3,303jam,Joey, (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,303jam,Ross, (entering) Hello. 
0,season3,303jam,Rachel, Hello.
0,season3,303jam,Ross," (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I
talk to you for a second?"
0,season3,303jam,Chandler, Sure. What's up?
0,season3,303jam,Ross," Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your
already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh, oh! It's on again!"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
0,season3,304towmt,All, Shhhh!
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
0,season3,304towmt,Mike, And there is Kevin.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, Can we please turn this off?
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Noo way, Kevin."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Well, it's official there are no good movies."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean
back into Monica.)"
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the
couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Hey, man. What's up?"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at
the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?!"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was
me! "
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, How is it you?
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was
in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him
her hand)"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Yep, that's my audition."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed
my chance."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,
she only talks to agents."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). "
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)
'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,
she'll know what it's about.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he
tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,
apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't
know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment, the world does not stop.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Is anybody else scared?
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is
it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to
Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she
tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Oh, now you want a pad."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a
Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a <em>Barbi</em>?"
0,season3,304towmt,Carol," He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it."
0,season3,304towmt,Susan," He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski
boots and a kicky beret."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
0,season3,304towmt,Susan," So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and
be in show business."
0,season3,304towmt,Carol," This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by
two women, does it?"
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the <em>Barbi</em> thing, so
am I."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Give daddy the <em>Barbi</em>! Ben, give, give me the <em>Barbi</em>.
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck
sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)"
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left
boob?"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," There it is. Joey, what are you doing?"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.
Go get me a sweater."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Noo.
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm
started going off in my head"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, Men are unbelievable.
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of
thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Hey, you know about that?!"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! "
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we
have any thoughts here?"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Amazingly, that makes sense."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, You think?
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Come on baby, come on!"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, Very nice touch.
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi
Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify
yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a
tunnel."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, Unbelievable.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, Thank you so much.
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, Two?
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love
you."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Nooo, four."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know
what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Oh, you didn't have to do this."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get. "
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought
that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more. We should take a trip."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, We should?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your
parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right
now! Are you okay?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably
say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, You probably want us to move in together?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, It doesn't scare me!
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You
know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about
moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a
little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice
to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, That is never good.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Then I got all needy and clingy.
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so
bad. How did you leave it?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, She said she'd call me.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Oh God.
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Yeah, you do."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want
her back you have to start acting aloof."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, She has to know that your not ready.
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose. And then act aloof."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, Oh.
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A
real American hero. I'm <em>G.I. Joe</em>!' Drop the <em>Barbi</em>, drop the <em>Barbi</em>."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, <em>G.I. Joe</em>? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, (entering) <em>G. I. Joe</em>! Cool! Can I play?
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, Pheebs! There you are!
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," No it's not, sorry."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in
those....pants."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I
got a shot at it."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," It's okay, these things happen."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, They actually said that?
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in
a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he
then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's
door, dead.)"
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," (to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him)
Chandler!"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," (in a British accent) Hello, Janice."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, What are you doing here?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, Are you being British?!
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, (normal voice) No. Not anymore.
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you
here waiting for me?"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)"
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, Where is this party?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Here in Chelsea.
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, Who's party is it?
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, A woman's
0,season3,304towmt,Janice, What woman?!
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, (shyly) Chelsea.
0,season3,304towmt,Janice," Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're
seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,
else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that
I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do
you want to be? (another guy walks by)"
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Can I be that guy?
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. "
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Okay, shoot."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, I didn't get it?
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can
work on that. "
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Okay, what else?"
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, Oh.
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," Yeah, no, I understand."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," You do, thanks."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)
0,season3,304towmt,Joey, Wait a minute.
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent."
0,season3,304towmt,Phoebe," (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
0,season3,304towmt,Joey," (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran
out of the store."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Yeah, it is."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," You know what, everything's gonna be okay. "
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, Hello!
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy."
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," Yes, and grumpy."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler," What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm
so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just
because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a
couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!"
0,season3,304towmt,Rachel," He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody
else by now."
0,season3,304towmt,Chandler, (on phone) I love you too.
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)"
0,season3,304towmt,Carol, <em>G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe</em>?!
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
0,season3,304towmt,Susan," What'd you do, dip it in sugar?"
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Look, <em>G. I. Joe</em>'s in, <em>Barbi</em>'s out. And if you guys can't
deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You
used to dress up like a woman."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, What?
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, What are you talking about?
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Okay, you are totally making this up."
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. 
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, (remembering) Oh God.
0,season3,304towmt,Susan, I've literally never been this happy.
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, Wasn't there a little song?
0,season3,304towmt,Carol," Oh please God, let there be a song."
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, (singing) '<em>I am Bea.</em>'
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,304towmt,Monica, '<em>I drink tea.</em>'
0,season3,304towmt,Ross," Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)"
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," '....<em>Won't you, won't you, won't you</em>.... '"
0,season3,304towmt,Ross, (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. 
0,season3,304towmt,Monica," A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Hey!
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
0,season3,305frank,Joey, No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Yeah!
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next
step."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Youre building a post office?
0,season3,305frank,Joey," No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a
one day job, max."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!
Those are snug."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Power saw kinda got away from me there.
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs. 
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Any sign of your brother?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," No, but hes always late."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, I thought you only met him once?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,
Franks always late."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Well relax, hell be here."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," No, I know, Im just nervous. Y'know its just y'know
Moms dead, dont talk to my sister, Grandmas been sleeping a lot lately.
Its like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
Youre so sweet to wait with me."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups out
here, its a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
0,season3,305frank,Monica," No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put
him on her freebie list."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Her what?
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that
we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad."
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex
with celebrities."
0,season3,305frank,Monica," So, Chandler, whos on your list?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,
Jessica Rabbit."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your
league?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop
out of her head."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Hey, Monica, who would yours be?"
0,season3,305frank,Monica," First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Its just a game Mon. (makes a Can-you-believe-her face
to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?"
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Oh, I dont know, I guess, Chris ODonnel, John F. Kennedy,
Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Spiderman?
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Hardy Boy.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Peter Parker.
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Thank you.
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," What about you honey, who would be on your list?"
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,
Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories...."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, (coughing) What a geek!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
0,season3,305frank,All," Oh, hi."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, This is everybody. This is Ross.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, How are you?
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Hey.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Chandler.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Hi.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Hi.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Joey.
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Hey-hey!
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Hey.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, This is Monica.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Whoa!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, And this is Rachel.
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Whoa!!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Im gonna get coffee.
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Hey, how do you guys get anything done?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," We dont, really."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and
everything."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick
up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a
hooker."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, I know.
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," No, you didnt get me!! Its an electric drill, you get
me, you kill me!!"
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, I do NOT want this unit!!
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader.
Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom
half of the door.)"
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Hey! Where ya headin in those pants? 1982?
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those
designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor."
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Why, whats wrong with my bathroom floor?"
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all."
0,season3,305frank,Monica, I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to
be. (Monica gasps) Yeah."
0,season3,305frank,Monica, I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes
right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in
his tight pants.)"
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
0,season3,305frank,Joey," (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of
this stuff is glued down. Itd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should
just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)"
0,season3,305frank,Monica, I cant leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Eh! There you go.
0,season3,305frank,Monica," You know thats nice, y'know we could put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," (sits up) Oh, ew!"
0,season3,305frank,Frank, What?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was
something I got from our Dad."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but cant)"
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Your not doing it.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have
that...."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Whens your birthday?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Feburary 16th.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, I know a guy whos the 18th.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Wow, thats close. Whens yours?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank, October 25th.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Melt stuff.
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Okay, Ive got three of my five."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Three of your five, what?"
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Susan Sarandon.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt
let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, And!! Isabella Rosselini.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too
international, y'know shes never gonna be around."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, So?
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the
country like all the time."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini,
geography."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Okay so, by melting, you meant melting."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Yeah.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, So is it like art?
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," No, I wanna melt it."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know Im just gonna go to bed, I
think the fumes are giving me a headache."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, (starts laughing) Yeah!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Gnight, bro."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Gnight.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguishers hose.)"
0,season3,305frank,Monica, What kind of karate is that?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, No kind. He just makes it up.
0,season3,305frank,Monica, So hows it going with you guys?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," So far, it kinda blows. I dont know, I just thought y'know that
hed feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and
connected and...."
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Oh honey, were close now but you-you wouldnt believe the
years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe
shakes her head like she doesnt understand) Thats where the waistband actually
goes over your head. "
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Ah!!
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, I just asked you.
0,season3,305frank,Monica, I just asked you.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, I dont have time for this.
0,season3,305frank,Monica," No, that is what the game is."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Which you just gave up really quickly.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, (entering) Have you seen Joey?
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Whats the matter?
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of
his pants.) Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where
we keep the varnish."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those
tiles."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Whats going on?
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Hes retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, He started mine first!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Whoa! Big octopus.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) Hello. (listens) Oh my
God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well cant someone else do it. (listens) But, I have
company. (listens) Yeah, no look, thats all right Ill come in. (hangs up
phone) Um, Frank, Im really sorry but I have to go to work. Its-its one
of my regulars and hes insisting that I do um."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Hey, what kind of work do you do?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Oh! Im a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
0,season3,305frank,Frank, You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Well, y'know we dont call it that, but yeah!"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," (starts laughing) Wow! Thats wild! No, I had no idea."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," All righty. Ill be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come
with me?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank, You mean like watch?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," No, no, you can get one yourself. Itll be on the house! Y'know
what are big sisters for?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Well, I dont think this, y'know."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!
Hey! Are you excited?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?"
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever
was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," What, like a number?"
0,season3,305frank,Ross, (entering) Hey! 
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Okay, Im done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little
card)"
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Well, its about time."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Ooh, very official."
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer."
0,season3,305frank,Monica, And who laminated it?
0,season3,305frank,Ross, That would be me.
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? "
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Hey, its my list."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Hey!-Hey! Whats going on?
0,season3,305frank,Frank, She broke my arm.
0,season3,305frank,Girl, He touched my fanny.
0,season3,305frank,Frank," No, she touched mine first!"
0,season3,305frank,Girl, Thats my job!
0,season3,305frank,Frank," So wait, whats the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I
cant touch you?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe and Girl, Ewww!!!
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, You cant have sex with her!
0,season3,305frank,Girl," Whatd you think I was, a hooker?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," No, your a masseuse, its cool, Im not a cop."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like
five minutes."
0,season3,305frank,Jasmine," Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I dont like you!!
(leaves)"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," (turns around and hits Frank) So thats what you thought I did!!
God! Thats not what I do!"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Wait thats-thats, what thats not what you do?"
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Nooo! Why would you think that?
0,season3,305frank,Frank," I dont know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I
mean, I dont know."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Whatever, its the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I cant believe that
I screwed it up so bad."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, You really thought it was perfect?
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasnt perfect, but y'know it was pretty
cool, y'know, cause we had all those great talks y'know."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my
likes and my dislikes..."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, I dont....
0,season3,305frank,Frank," How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesnt
melt."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Right, okay, um-mm."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you cause y'know
youre my sister, y'know."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Well, I-I wasnt hopping mad, y'know."
0,season3,305frank,Frank," You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe," Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,
this."
0,season3,305frank,Frank, This?
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I
almost got arm broken by a hooker..."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, She wasnt a hooker.
0,season3,305frank,Frank," Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. "
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Okay, on three. One....Two...."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Why dont we just go on two.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Why two?
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Because its faster.
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this
two talk."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Oh!
0,season3,305frank,Joey," All right, but in the future..."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Okay!! Okay!!
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Come on!
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Okay, one...two..."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, So we are going on two?
0,season3,305frank,All," All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,
the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Oh, good job Joe."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Wow, its big!"
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! "
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Maybe, my rulers wrong."
0,season3,305frank,Phoebe, Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a
little of my door."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks
none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move
it, but it doesnt move.)"
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,
double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy
nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella," (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
0,season3,305frank,Ross, Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
0,season3,305frank,Monica, Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Yeah, maybe."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Oh-oh, you lie."
0,season3,305frank,Ross, What you dont think Id go up to her?
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate."
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Okay, hold my crawler."
0,season3,305frank,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,305frank,Monica," Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
0,season3,305frank,Rachel," Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just
sorry we dont got popcorn."
0,season3,305frank,Ross," (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im
a big, big fan of yours. I mean, <i>Blue Velvet</i>, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I
could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you
for that one? "
0,season3,305frank,Isabella," Arent you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who
waves back)"
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding,
um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so Im allowed
to sleep with you. No, no, no, its flattery."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, Im sorry. (starts to leave)
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Dont, dont just dismiss
this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity..."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella," Yeah, for you. Is that the list?"
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Um, yeah."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, May I see it?
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Um, no."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, Come on! (grabs the list)
0,season3,305frank,Ross," But, okay."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, (reading it) Im not on the list!
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Um, see, but thats not the final draft."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, Its laminated!
0,season3,305frank,Ross," Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler
(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped
you for Wynona Rider, local."
0,season3,305frank,Isabella, Y'know its ironic...
0,season3,305frank,Ross, What?
0,season3,305frank,Isabella," ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday
I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)"
0,season3,305frank,Ross, (to the rest of the gang) Were just gonna be friends.
0,season3,305frank,Joey, Y'know what?
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Umm?
0,season3,305frank,Joey, I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
0,season3,305frank,Chandler, Ive got five bucks says you cant.
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Get out your checkbook, mister."
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Oh, I think I have the cash."
0,season3,305frank,Joey, You are dogged man! I totally fit!
0,season3,305frank,Chandler," Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so
that the doors wont open) Im out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack
between the door and frame) Here you go."
0,season3,305frank,Joey," Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.
Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks
are on me!"
0,season3,306flash,Janice," Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of
you?"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Wow, its like a dirty math problem."
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Im sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
0,season3,306flash,Janice," Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Well, thats really a different question."
0,season3,306flash,Janice," Im sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who
spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
0,season3,306flash,Monica and Rachel, What?!!
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Excuse me, there was no time!"
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Okay, but lets say there was. How might that go?"
0,season3,306flash,Janice," Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel, Does anybody need more coffee?
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Yeah, Ill take some."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Hey, theres a dog out there!"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Oh, that is so unfortunate."
0,season3,306flash,Ross, What?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," (entering from bedroom) Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh,
Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye. (leaves)"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) Thats why I moved out.
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister
that you dont live here anymore."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, I think on some levels she already knows.
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she
doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that
youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Okay, well maybe not on those levels."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," (entering, with a goatee) Hey."
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Hey.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Im never gonna find a roommate, ever."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Why, nobody good?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats
plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need
to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing <i>Bing!</i>
Great apartment Chandler Bing, <i>Bing!</i>"
0,season3,306flash,Ross, So how many more do you have tomorrow?
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,
who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone
Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the
floor or come over no more!"
0,season3,306flash,Ross," (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What?
0,season3,306flash,Ross," I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo..."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Umm, hows it going with you guys?"
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were
having so much trouble lately."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Oh, really?"
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any
close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan
something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
0,season3,306flash,Eric," Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope
thats cool."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
0,season3,306flash,Eric," Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters
beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell
you, shes a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless
it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. (Eric offers
to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.
Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)
Bye-bye."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Sure. Ummm. Whats up?
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.
Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, What gay thing?
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. Im totally cool
with that."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Hi.
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Hey!
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Hey, Mon."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Do I ever.
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, No way!
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Got me.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, (to bartender) Can I get a beer.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, You betcha!
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Is it the Italian guy?
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Um-mm, yeah right!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Hes so cute.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around
with and be referred to as the funny one."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back
in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Okay, but after that, were shootin some pool."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,
no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I
ordered a rum and <i>Diet Coke</i>, which I dont think this is."
0,season3,306flash,Waitress, I am so sorry.
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Thats all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a
couple drinks right, huh?"
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 1," Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one
year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Ummm, I think its time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out
and they all scream)"
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 2," Oh, isnt it exciting, I mean its like having a
boyfriend for life."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Yeah, I know."
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 1, What?
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Oh, I dont know. Well maybe its just the idea of Barry for
the rest of my life. I dont know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,
y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)"
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 1, Rachel stop!
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 2, Youre so bad!
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Im serious, I really, I think I need just to have
some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Yeah, so?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," (picks it up) And now Ive picked it up again. (walks over to
Monica.)"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh my God, you cant even see where the Titanic hit it."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Yes, his name is Barry, hes a doctor, thank you very much."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Thank you. So how-how bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Aww, not right now."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Oh, but thats okay."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, I know.
0,season3,306flash,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," So, Ill get-get back to my friend."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the
cue ball as a Remember me? thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next
time Im in the city?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh, thatd be great."
0,season3,306flash,Rachel, Okay!
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Thanks.
0,season3,306flash,Rachel, Bye!
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my
life."
0,season3,306flash,Ross," No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,
no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, So what are they doing?
0,season3,306flash,Ross," I dont know, something girlie."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," (to Monica, whos entering) Hey, youre early."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What are you doing with the lamp?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Im just taking it to be re-wired.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo,
cause theyve had that thing for over a week."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, You dont play the oboe!
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, I could play the oboe!
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in
his face.)"
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, (to Eric) Who are you?
0,season3,306flash,Eric," Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate."
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, Im Chandlers new roommate.
0,season3,306flash,Eric, I-I-I dont think so.
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, I could be Chandlers new roommate.
0,season3,306flash,Eric," But, he told me over the phone."
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles, He told me in person.
0,season3,306flash,Eric, Thats weird.
0,season3,306flash,Mr. Heckles," Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to
the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Hi, again."
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Hey! (goes into the apartment)
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, (leaving to go to work) Hey!
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Thank you soo, much."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I
gotta get to get to work."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, You want some help with that?
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I dont!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Whoa! Are you okay?
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Its the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)
And-and the humidity."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Thats a uh, thats a tough combination."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Like you wouldnt believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is
a great place."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Gotcha.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," This place is really my Grandmothers. (Joey starts to take off all
of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her
when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the
landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. So are you
thirsty?"
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Oh, you bet I am!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," (turning around) Okay, heres your penis!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
0,season3,306flash,Joey," You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, So?!
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Oh right, right."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to
you that means they wanna have sex?"
0,season3,306flash,Joey," Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. Im such a jerk."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,
but... By the way I can still see it."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Pheebs?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Huh?
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Wheres your bed?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Its not in the apartment? (Monica gives a Come on
look) Oh no. I cant believe this is happening again."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Okay, enough with the third degree! I-Ive, I dont live here
anymore."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What are you talking about?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Im sorry, I-I-I-I dont live here anymore. I-I didnt
know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Everybody knows!
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,
I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got
like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. "
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other
side."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What?!?!
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a
land where people can spill."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, You can spill. In the sink.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I
love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that
happening."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," I love you, too. "
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Aww, good. (they hug) What?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, What? Im just said.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," So ah, whatcha watching?"
0,season3,306flash,Joey, <i>Baywatch.</i>
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Whats it about?
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Lifeguards.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Whos she?"
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Wow! Look at them run.
0,season3,306flash,Joey," They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Yeah, Ill go get one."
0,season3,306flash,Joey," No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Well, hello!"
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Hey.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Do you have any beers? Were out of beers.
0,season3,306flash,Monica, (all depressed) Help yourself.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, You okay?
0,season3,306flash,Monica, Phoebe moved out.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, Right.
0,season3,306flash,Monica," I dont understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I
dont have a boyfriend?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Noo!! You dont have a boyfriend because....I dont, I
dont know why you dont have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Well, I think so."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my
favourite people and the most beautiful woman Ive ever known in real life."
0,season3,306flash,Ross, (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is
wrong?"
0,season3,306flash,Ross," My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Oh no! Why?
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Cause Carols a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and Im
not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
0,season3,306flash,Ross," (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many
drinks) Im an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and
shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look
at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Well, now I do!!"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Im sorry.
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Seven years. I mean weve been together seven years, shes the
only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever...."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Umm, this is nice."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," I know, it is isnt it?"
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle
a nuclear device."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
0,season3,306flash,Chandler," Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,
its, its gonna be...."
0,season3,306flash,Monica, I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or
Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I cant believe this!"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
Youre, youre really, youre so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Thanks.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," And youre so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And
youre kind (kisses him on the lips)"
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Huh?
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Okay, its okay."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, Oh. (they start kissing again)
0,season3,306flash,Ross," Wait, wait, wait."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,306flash,Ross, My foot is stuck in the pocket.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,306flash,Ross," No, I cant get it out."
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Well, thats not something a girl wants to hear."
0,season3,306flash,Ross," No, come on dont start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!"
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Oh well. It probably wouldve been the most constructive solution.
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe, You have chalk on your face.
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
0,season3,306flash,Phoebe," Oh, Ross youre right, I dont know why I always thought this
was real grass."
0,season3,306flash,Monica," Hey, are you okay?"
0,season3,306flash,Ross, My wifes a lesbian.
0,season3,306flash,Joey, Cool!!
0,season3,306flash,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,306flash,Chandler, I cant believe you came back.
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Dont say anything. I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna
think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 2," Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, shes in her
car driving back from the city)"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel, What?
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 2, You missed the exit!
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Oh, sorry."
0,season3,306flash,Friend No. 1," My God, what were you thinking about?"
0,season3,306flash,Rachel," Um, (shyly) Barry."
0,season3,306flash,Her Friends, Awwww!!
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,
nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur. But of course this went in one ear and
out....."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," <i>I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend
hes Alan Alda.</i>"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," <i>Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?</i>"
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," <i>If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that
would be the best.</i>"
0,season3,307rcb,Gunther," <i>What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my
wife.</i>"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, <i>Whos singing?</i>
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Hey. When you guys were kids and you played <i>Happy Days</i>, who were
you? I was always Richie."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, I was always Joanne.
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your
neighbourhood?"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Booo!!
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," (to Janice) Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the
channel!"
0,season3,307rcb,Janice," Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine."
0,season3,307rcb,Matress King," (on TV) <i>Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom
is suddenly without a queen. Im so depressed Im going to slash... my prices!!
Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! Im going medieval on
prices!</i>"
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler, What a wank!
0,season3,307rcb,Janice," Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about
the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And Im
appalled for you by the way."
0,season3,307rcb,Matress King, (on TV) <i>Im close. Im cheap. Im the king.</i>
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy well see you tomorrow night.
(listens) Okay bye-bye. (hangs up)"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, We?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope thats
okay."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Oh shoot, tomorrows not so good, Im supposed to um, fall off
the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Ross, my father doesnt hate you."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Please, he refers to me as wethead."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all
right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you
like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do
come to dinner, Ill love you like I do in that black thing that you like."
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler, (leaning in) Ill go.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Fine.
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Hi Gunther.
0,season3,307rcb,Gunther," Yeah, well see!"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," (entering) Hey, you guys!"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Guess what?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, What?
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, I got a gig!
0,season3,307rcb,All, Yay!!
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," See, thats why I could never be an actor. Because I cant
say gig."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Yeah, I cant say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, Whats the part?
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Well, its not a part, no. Im teaching acting for soap operas
down at the Learning Extension."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Come on! Thats great.
0,season3,307rcb,All, Wow!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Yeah, yeah. Its like my chance to give something back to the acting
community."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Yknow your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, (glares at him) I know!
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Ugh! I dont know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if
you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, Not at these prices.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in
England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and
she makes the that went right over your head motion) Woo!"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this
is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...
(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other
friends."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Good evening. Im Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for
soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on <i>Days of Our
Lives</i>, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of
the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting
again, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like
this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,
thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will
have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Hi!
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, Hey, the bell
doesnt dismiss you, I dismiss you."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Ooooh, nice."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for <i>All My Children</i>."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Oh, yay!"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Yeah, its this great part, this boxer named Nick. And Im so,
so right for it, y'know, hes just like me. Except hes a boxer, and has an evil
twin."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black
delievery guy.) "
0,season3,307rcb,Guy," Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to
Phoebe) You Miss Geller?"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season3,307rcb,Guy, Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. Its
that bedroom there. (points to Monicas room)"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Yeah, so please, please, please, dont say anything to Chandler."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, You want me to lie to Chandler?
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Is that a problem?
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, No.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer lets see what you got. All right ya,
put em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Hey, youre ah, pretty good at this."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young
men werent acting Christian enough."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Ahh!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Hey now!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Hey!!! Oww!! And Im bleeding.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Okay, great."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Wow! And Im a vegetarian! All right, all right, well Im
sorry, well put some ice on it. "
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Okay.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Kay, put your head back."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, All right. I cant see.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," All right, I have ya. Oh God."
0,season3,307rcb,Guy, Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Oh, its the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
0,season3,307rcb,Guy, Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Hi Daddy!
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," This where they put it? What, there no table available in the
kitchen! Hello, baby."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, You remember Ross.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Um-hmm.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is
successful.) (to Ross) Hows the library?"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Ugh, museum."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, What happened to the library?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,
I never worked at one."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," You know whats really good here, the lobster. What do you say
shall I just order three."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Yeah, if youre really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a
joke, I made a joke."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of
person that works at a library."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Its not a library...
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," (interrupting him) I know!! Its a museum! What, youre the
only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will
have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I dont know to the waiter.)"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," So, Dr. Green, hows the old boat."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, It gives it a nice antiquey look.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Wow. Im sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel
giggles at that)"
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to
the Levines, before we go."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Aw honey stop! Its not that bad.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad mustve added
wrong. He only tipped like four percent."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Yeah. Thats Daddy.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Thats Daddy?! But doesnt it bother you? Youre a
waitress."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee
house, Id be serving him sneezers."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, So?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," So. Ross, Ive bugged him about this a million times, hes not
gonna change."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, You really serve people sneezers?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Well um, I dont."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr Green, You kids ready?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Thanks again, Dr. Green."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, All right.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Oh, ah, you dont need that."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Why not?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," The carbon, its messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,
the, the ah, night blindness."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a
twenty down here? Huh?"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too
much, way, way, too much, its a sickness really."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something
about that."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, I know.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Excuse me, you think Im cheap?"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Oh Daddy, no he didnt mean anything by that, he really
didnt."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Nothing I do means anything, really."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down
twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here, Ill tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up
the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead.
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, Ive never been able to cry as
an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that
Ive just done something evil. That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend
fishhook.) Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And thats how its done. Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
0,season3,307rcb,Student," Hey, Mr. Trib."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Hey-hey.
0,season3,307rcb,Student," Guess what, I got an audition!"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud."
0,season3,307rcb,Student, I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, You bet! Whats the part?
0,season3,307rcb,Student," Oh its great, its a role on <i>All My Children</i>, Nick
the boxer."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it
alone."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my
food."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and
rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Im, Im freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something
and she shouldnt have! All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to
ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Um. yeah.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, I am soo dead. (goes to Monicas room)
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if
we act fast, okay. So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats
why you have got to be the bigger man here."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me?"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay
were never gonna get along."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) Ill get the bagels."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, (sees the bed) Whats this?
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Isnt it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, This is not the bed I ordered!
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," I know, you mustve won like a contest or something! "
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, Phoebe!
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, Why is this car in my bedroom?
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Im sorry, okay, I-I wasnt looking, and the store says that
they wont take it back because you signed for it..."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, When did I sign for it?
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," When I was you! Y'know what, its all Joeys fault,
cause he left his nose open!"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica, Did you make brownies today?
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," Knock, knock."
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he wont notice the bed."
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," Hey, Im going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the
bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe, Its Monicas bed. What?
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler, Okay. (to Monica) Its a racecar.
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just
noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on
the mattress?"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers
her, her hand to comfort her.)"
0,season3,307rcb,Student," Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,
thats not gonna be me, not me."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
0,season3,307rcb,Student, No.
0,season3,307rcb,Joey, Whoa. That was really good.
0,season3,307rcb,Student," Thanks, any suggestions?"
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler, You told him to play the boxer gay!!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Well, I-I mightve said supergay."
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler, You totally screwed him over.
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this
part."
0,season3,307rcb,Phoebe," Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, (opening the door) Hi Daddy.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Baby. Ross.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on
it.)"
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Thanks for dinner last night.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Nice hair. Whatd ya do? Swim here?
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," (to Rachel) Okay, thats it, I cant take it anymore."
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," What? What? Hes interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just
wants to know how you got here."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Oh, please. Sweetie its hopeless, okay, Im just gonna go.
(starts to leave rubbing his neck)"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, What?!
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Look, look Im sorry. Its just that...."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Ross? Whats with the neck?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Hes got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my
chiropractor..."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Youre still going to that chiropractor, that man couldnt
get into medical school in Extapa!"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Thank you! Thats what I keep saying.
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Uh.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Well thats his last name.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, And his first name.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Hes Bobby Bobby?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, Its Robert Bobby.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Oh.
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," And um, excuse me, he helps me."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, What do you need help for?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, With my alignment. Ive got one leg shorter than the other.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Oh God!
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Argue with that.
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," What? Its true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Come on! Youre just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, I know that!
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Im sorry, let her?"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," What can I do, she doesnt listen to me about renters insurance
either."
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Wait a minute, you dont have renters insurance?!"
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel, No.
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green," Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after
him with one leg shorter than the other?!"
0,season3,307rcb,Ross," Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
0,season3,307rcb,Dr. Green, Id love some juice. Thanks.
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
0,season3,307rcb,Rachel," Yeah honey, Im standing right there! Why didnt you just tell
him about the mole I havent got checked yet."
0,season3,307rcb,Ross, Excellent!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when youll
have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present. And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, hes got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me
Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on
TV. Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from
his students.) Thank you."
0,season3,307rcb,Jester," Uh, may I help you?"
0,season3,307rcb,Monica," Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck
with the racecar bed."
0,season3,307rcb,Jester," Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You
signed for it, Monica Velula Geller."
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
0,season3,307rcb,Jester, Nobody sees the king!
0,season3,307rcb,Joey," Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)"
0,season3,307rcb,Jester, Hey! You cant go back there!
0,season3,307rcb,Janice, Oh my God.
0,season3,307rcb,Chandler," Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching
sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin! (honks the
beds little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)
All right, Ill leave. My beds so boring."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Okay, Im not gonna have one."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," No, no, its just my tooth."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," All right Ill have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Why? Why cant you go to him?
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down
the hygienists blouse."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, And all these people actually died?
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Yes, while I was in the chair! Thats why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist. Its, its, its just ah, a
coincidence."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up
and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?"
0,season3,308gpd,Gunther," Oh, like you dont already have everything."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," All right, fine, fine, but if youre my next victim, dont
come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, I promise.
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Although, dont feel like you cant visit."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no hes
not."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going
to tell Chandler?"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to
not."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you
have to tell him."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe Ill
kill him."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.
Its like a <i>Play-Doo</i> Fat Factory. "
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Well, Im going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the
look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,
or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all
that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids
messed up the Homo Sapien display."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, What did they do?
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Well, they painted over the word Sapien for one thing, then
they rearranged the figures, lets just leave it at that."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Yes, thats what I was going to ask, thank you."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths
Dont worry, Ill be here the whole time. to Ross.) Yes! Thatd
be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica
sarcastically mouths Yeah! and holds up her thumb.)"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Hey-hey, Ross?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, Ive got a science question.
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Hmm?
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact Homo-sapien, is that why
there extinct?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Joey, Homo Sapiens are people."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Hey-hey, Im not judging."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come
on! All right, y'know what I think hes bored."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show
Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) Were gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in
the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it
again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits
Bens head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)"
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," (to Ben) Whos so brave, youre so brave, yes you are,
youre so brave."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Okay. Okay honey, hes fine, hes fine, lets just put
him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See thats a good boy. (to Monica)
How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!"
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Hes not gonna say anything, because were not gonna tell him."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Were not?!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, No were not.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," All right, I like that. "
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Okay.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," So were okay, were okay, were okay, (starts to exam
Ben) arent we? No, were not okay, were not okay, theres a bump,
theres a bump."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, I cannot push it in!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Okay, were gonna need a distraction."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, I got it!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to
your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!"
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Or. We could put a hat on his head.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, We need a hat..
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!! (runs to get him)"
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Because hell know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a
bear thats dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, youre a genius!"
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Give it. Give it.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica and Rachel, Oh!!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are
nice?"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, Id really prefer a mountain bike.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something
speacial. Come in here with me."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something
speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba
birthday. I would like to get her something serious."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get
her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me
anything ever. (starts to go into the store)"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," (stopping him) No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you
cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you
cant."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, Why not?!
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the
thing is..."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, What is the thing?
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw
Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, (shocked) What?
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, They were in his office.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with
me."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Im telling you man, I saw it."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema
doesnt sound so bad now, huh?"
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Right.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, (running through the door) No! Oh! Youre alive! Youre alive!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didnt I?"
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Yeah, well, well see about that. Can I use your phone? I just
wanna call everyone I know."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Sure, we have no money, go ahead."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," (on phone) Hey! Youre not dead! Okay, see ya!"
0,season3,308gpd,Ben, Monica.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
0,season3,308gpd,Ben, Monica bang!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Okay, I heard that."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Did he just say Monica bang?
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Oh my God! Hes gonna rat me out!
0,season3,308gpd,Ben, Monica bang!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. Its
no big deal, its not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See
watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica
bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats)
Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isnt that fun?"
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look
at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, Im stopping now."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, You okay?
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Oh yeah! Y'know, if its not a headboard, its just not worth
it."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, (entering) Hows my Bing-a-ling?
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Ah, I dont know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,
because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Why are your eyes so white?
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," You tell me! Maybe, its because I was just fooling with my ex!
Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Oh my God!!
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, All right!
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, How did you know?
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, In the park?
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Just those two!
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no
kissing!!"
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," Oh, Im sorry honey, Im so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! Im
so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I cant
breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, (giving her a bag) Here.
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, The receipt.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Ill take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with
me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do
you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her
head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) Im gonna need an actual answer here okay,
so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)"
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, I dont know.
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, (rushing in) Okay. If youre alive you answer your phone!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for
dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of
bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, You said number two.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, I also said number one.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, I know. (giggles harder)
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, (entering) Hey! Everyone.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Hows my little boy?
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Hes perfect, hes never been better."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," (noticing the outfit he is wearing) Whatd you do, take him whaling?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ben, Monica.
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Oh my God, he just said your name, thats great! Good job Ben."
0,season3,308gpd,Ben, Monica bang!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Oh thats right, thats what Id sound like if I
exploded."
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is
alive."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, Uh.
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,308gpd,Joey, Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting
stronger too, to bring down something that big."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Well maybe hes just taking a nap.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Im tellin ya, he hasnt moved since this morning."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," All right, we should call somebody."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isnt
moving."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Well, we have gotta find out if hes alive."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, How are we gonna do that? Theres no way.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Well, there is one way. His windows open, I say, we poke him."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when
we get Chinese food?"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Well, now we got a reason."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, What?
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Well, were fashioning a very long poking device."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, All right.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Hey uh, whats a matter?"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, I talked to Janice.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," She doesnt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this
morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that
twelve pack of condoms. And now I cant even return them, because she choked on the
reciept!"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," I dont know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Well, it doesnt matter what I would do."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Come on, tell me."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it
was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I
would bow out."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey
quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?"
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," They have a kid together, y'know. Theyre like, theyre like a
family, and if, I dont know, theres chance they could make that work, I know I
wouldnt want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna
ah, come poke a nude guy?"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Well, hes finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Are you, are you, are you sure its ah, a new bump? I mean, no
offense, Ive always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Its okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,
y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, (confidently) I did!
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, I know! Im saying you have to watch them all the time.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against
that thing!"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Monica did it?
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Monica?
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Yeah.
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, No. Why?
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet
song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out e
and f. Its like they just ah, I dont know, fell out of his head."
0,season3,308gpd,Monica, Really?!
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his left
leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort of
y'know... (walks around in a circle) "
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)"
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, I hope its still funny when youre in hell.
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
(starts to chase Ross around the living room)"
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel, Ill get the hat.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me
get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Okay.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guy
that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you are
the reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matter
how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Wow!
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," Oh! Youre right. Oh God. But, before I can say
good-bye, theres something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way
I feel about you, its like, I finally understand what Lionel Richies been
singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my
soulmate, and I cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our
lives together."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, Then dont leave me!
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, What?
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-Ive got to give my
marriage another chance."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," No you dont! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance."
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, (standing up) Im sorry. (hugs him)
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, Ohhh. Dont go.
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesnt
let her go.)"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, No. No! No! No!
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," Honey, honey, people are looking."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," I dont care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I
dont care!!"
0,season3,308gpd,Janice," Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of
Chandlers grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, You cant leave! I have your shoe!
0,season3,308gpd,Janice, Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
0,season3,308gpd,Gunther, Rachel has those in burgendy.
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be
difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross," Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!"
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe," Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a
dead fat guy on a stick."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke. (they start to advance
the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay, were approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their
view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the
needle. "
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
0,season3,308gpd,Monica," And yet, were still poking him."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
0,season3,308gpd,Ross, He does not look happy.
0,season3,308gpd,Rachel," Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device."
0,season3,308gpd,Joey," Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler," (singing) <em>Ill hold you close in my arms</em>. (Phoebe
enters) <em>I cant resist your charms. And love....</em>"
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, (joining him) <em>Love....</em>
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler and Phoebe," <em>Ill be a fool for you. Im sure, you know I
dont mind</em>."
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, (high pitched) <em>No you know I dont mind</em>.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler and Phoebe, <em>Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...</em>
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, <em>I know</em>.
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, <em>I know</em>.
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler, <em>Ive found</em>.
0,season3,308gpd,Phoebe, <em>Ive found....</em>
0,season3,308gpd,Chandler and Phoebe," <em>...in you, my endless</em> (Phoebe goes high pitched,
Chandler goes low pitched) <em>love</em>. (they both look at each other.) <em>My endless
love</em>. (once again they dont match tones, and they just look at each other)"
0,season3,309towfb,The Guys, (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching
football, you could help."
0,season3,309towfb,The Guys, We will. (they dont move)
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want
to do this. "
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Every year.
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these
things. (just as she sits down)."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Halftime.
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little
three on three going?"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Oh, can I play too? Ive never played football, like ever. "
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Great, you can cover Chandler."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Dont say that I
dont have goals!"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dont
play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Yeah, all right, Ill play."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Yay!!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Lets do it! Ross?
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, What?
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Do you wanna play football?
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Says who? Your mom?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica and Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the Geller Bowl."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No, no, no, you say that proudly."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kindve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," To score the winning touchdown, by the way."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Oh yeah! Then how come you didnt get the Geller Cup?
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Um, there was a Geller Cup?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,
nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it
in the lake."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, And was the curse lifted?
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Anyway. Thats when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, its
been twelve years."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Can I see you for a second?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, (shouting) Once!!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," All right, were gonna play."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because
my Mom wont let me cross the street."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Okay. Lets bring it in.
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Here you go. (throws her the ball)
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the
face."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," All right, we have to pick captains."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, And then Tineals.
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Okay, so how do we decide that?"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Well, why dont we just bunny up."
0,season3,309towfb,"Rachel, Chandler, and Joey", What?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica and Ross," (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit
ears with their fingers.) Bunny!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first
so that means I get to pick first. Joey."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Thank you.
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Monica, Im your best friend."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Sweetie, dont worry youll get picked. Chandler."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Ross!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Phoebe.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Sweetie, now I pick you."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, You dont pick me! Youre stuck with me!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay. All right. So lets see, lets play from the trash can, to
the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, well kick off."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes
before I have to baste again."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Wow! Just like in the pros.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Huddle up.
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Okay.
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Okay, Phoebe you know what youre doing right?"
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Okay, Joeys gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Whats block?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Phoebe, I thought you said you know what youre doing?"
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, I thought you meant in life.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Break.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but
kicks Rosss foot instead.)"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, I got it. (catches the ball)
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Go! Go! Go!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Score!! 7 to nothing!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Come on, lets go!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Losers walk!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Yeah, losers talk!"
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts
his hands between Rosss legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and
looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Yeah!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, (from the shotgun) Hike!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica and Joey, One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Over here!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the
right. Okay. Break!"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Wait, what am I gonna do?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," You, you go long."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Wait, how long?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Until we start to look very small.
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Break!!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Set....hike!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!"
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No, no, no, no, no!"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball."
0,season3,309towfb,Woman, (in a foreign accent) You are playing American football?
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country."
0,season3,309towfb,Woman, Im Dutch.
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Hi-hi, Im Joey."
0,season3,309towfb,Woman, Im Margha.
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees
Marhan) Hi, Im Chandler."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," Hello, Chandler."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha, Margha.
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Mar-klan.
0,season3,309towfb,Margha, Mar-gha.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Mar-haaaan.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Come on guys! Lets go! Come on, its second down."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Uh, hello, its third down."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," No its not, its second."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Wow!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Wow, what?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Pulling what? Its second down.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, its second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you
need."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, I heard that!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Well, I said it loud."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," It is okay, if I stay and watch?"
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler and Joey," Yeah! Why dont you stick around. You can sit right
there."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Well, that went well."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, I think so.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it
myself, y'know."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of
that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, Ill let you have
her."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnt
I wouldnt have a shot?"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel bad
man, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget
about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And
sweetie.."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, its like all Im doing is
running back and forth from the huddle."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Can I see that for second.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Okay. Hut! Hike!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Fumble!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, What the hells the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," All right, thats it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But
now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or
something about you thats mean!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right, come on guys, lets go! Tie score, and were
runnin out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica
throws the ball to Phoebe.)"
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Pheebs, run!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Run, Phoebe, run!"
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesnt count."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, After the snap!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Before the snap!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, After!!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Before!!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Now, does it really matter?"
0,season3,309towfb,All, Yes!!
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Oh Pheebs, thats great. It doesnt count."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Does so count!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Oh my God!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Y'know what, thats fine, maybe you havent grown up, but I
have."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Oh-ho, okay."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go
ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Woo-yay!!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," No! Listen, Im not gonna go through this with you again, okay.
Just once I wanna beat when you cant blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the
fact that you thought you were getting mono. Lets just call this, tie score and
its halftime."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, first of all, I dont play with cheaters, and second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Y'know what? Ill think youll play.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Oh really! Why is that?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Because the winner gets this!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, The Geller Cup.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
0,season3,309towfb,All, Yeah.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Okay, good."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I
swam into the lake and fished it out."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, That cup is mine!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," All right, so are we not having dinner at all?"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Come on Phoebe, lets go! Come on, its time to get serious,
huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Its hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able
to focus?"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, What are you gonna do?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, Ill
take care of the rest."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Okay.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Break!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Here you go!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Chandler! Chandler!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, (to Margha) Hi.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya dont see that everyday, do
ya?"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats with the tackling?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, What?! I just touched him and he went over.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, I love this game!!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Hey, whered you get that?"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, I went really long.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were
winning because Im better than you."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, Ill
prove it to you, okay. Ill trade you Joey for Rachel, and Ill still win the
game."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica,
because Im only down by three touchdowns."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey youre with me."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, I can not believe your trading me!!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Come on Rach, come on. Lets see whats it like to be on a
winning team for a change."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Are you gonna let me play?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, All right then.
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?"
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching
teams."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that its better if were
on the same team."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Right. Okay, lets play. Lets go."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the
Netherlands, right?"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," Oh, my."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Lets play some ball,
guys."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-Im not playing with this guy, now."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Fine with me.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Okay, y'know what, lets just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,
which of my boys do you like?"
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler and Joey, What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
0,season3,309towfb,Margha, Which do I like?
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your
windmill..."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,
I would have to say, Chandler."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Yes!!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnt understand the
question."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Well, you dont you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," Im sorry, Joey, that is my chose."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," You hear that! That is her chose, mister Ill let you have her! I
win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)"
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," Im now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Wh-what?
0,season3,309towfb,Margha," I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Y'know what, it doesnt matter, cause she picked me. Me!
From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching <i>Ready,
Set, Cook!</i>"
0,season3,309towfb,Ross," Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no
time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls."
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler, Were not gonna lose to girls.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Hey! Its 42-21!
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just
think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while
youre making out..."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Lets kill
um!"
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Yeah!!! Kill um!!!
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how
are we gonna beat three boys?"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down
by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a
slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, No! Come on! Dont make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," Honey, theres a reason."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," God, Im not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you
let me throw, come on this is my game too."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Come on Mon, let her throw the ball."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right Rachel, you sweep behind, Ill pitch it to you, you throw
it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Thank you! Break!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
0,season3,309towfb,The Guys, One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Im so sorry! Are you okay?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, No! Im not okay!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," Im sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didnt know
what to do."
0,season3,309towfb,Joey, (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Come on! Come on! Hurry! Were running out of time! Huddle up!
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica," All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, (on the verge of tears) Okay.
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Break!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at
that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!"
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody
tagged Rachel, then isnt the play still going."
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Let go! Let go!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important
who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not
you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Ow!!
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel," We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe theres a like
league we could join or something."
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe, Isnt there a national football league.
0,season3,309towfb,Chandler," Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
0,season3,309towfb,Rachel, Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
0,season3,309towfb,Phoebe," Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
0,season3,309towfb,Joey," When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in."
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Let go!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, No! You let go!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, No!
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, How come its always us left in the field holding the ball?
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, I dont know. I guess the other people just dont care enough.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Hey! Its starting to snow.
0,season3,309towfb,Ross, Gimme the this!
0,season3,309towfb,Monica, Let go!
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," (reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, What?
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still
be allowed to fly this thing?"
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, Rachel?
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks
getting trained by another waitress?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training
again, whenever."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, (thinks about it) Yeah?
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown
Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,
then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird
flapping its wings.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, I was shrieking... like a Marine.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship
play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a
backswing and hits Sarah whos started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both
watch in horror.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, You broke a little girls leg?!!
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on <i>Seasame
Street</i> last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Well, Im gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do
you think shell like?"
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," Maybe a <i>Hello Kitty</i> doll, the ability to walk..."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, Im gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Look out kids, hes coming! (Ross continues to leave with his
head down in shame.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Have fun. Oh wait, no, dont! I forgot I am totally against that
now."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, What? Me having a job?
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and
their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,
how do you sleep at night?"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Well, Im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,
Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their
fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, Really?
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of
them, its the only chance to see New York."
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," ...and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty
tray...."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Gunther, Gunther, please, Ive worked here for two and a half
years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of
empty trays on the back counter.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Huh. Well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that
way theyll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses
do that too."
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," They already do. Thats why they call it the tray
spot."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it
was a club they went to. Oh God, Im, Im sorry. (walks away)"
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, Its all right. Sweetheart.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that
you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those
cookies anymore. "
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,
as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj
Mahal."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the
way to India."
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes
gonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to
sell in order to win?"
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah, The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," So far, Ive sold seventy-five."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his
wallet) How much are the boxes?"
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah, Five dollars a box.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," A ten speed bike. But, Id rather have something my Dad
couldnt sell."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Well, that makes sense."
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," Could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Yeah, Sarah, anything."
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a TV, the lady across the
alley said shed push hers up to a window, so I could watch it."
0,season3,310rquit,Woman," (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)
Yesss?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies."
0,season3,310rquit,Woman," Youre no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," No, hi, Im, Im an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird
salute.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Woman, What does that mean?
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but Im not invited to
sleep-overs."
0,season3,310rquit,Woman," I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," No, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go
to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
0,season3,310rquit,Woman," Im pressing, a policeman is on his way."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Okay, okay! Im going. Im going. (goes across the hall to knock
on another door.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Woman, I can still see you!
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, All right!!
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, (walking up to Joey) Hey.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,
all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh..."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, Destiny.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, Sure.
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, Yes.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, All right.
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Okay. (One of Joeys co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!
That one doesnt look very fulfilled."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just
taking it to the back."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," So, what happens to the old guys?"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Well, they go into the chipper."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds? (Joey
points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play
in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against
Joeys shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the cut
it motion with his hands)"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,
Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to
Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you
what, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Mon?
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and
thats it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)
Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because
you ate them all. But ah, y'know Im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why
dont I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the
Rudolphs."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, No.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Oh, come on, now you know you want em."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Ill tell you what Mon, Ill give you the first box for free."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Come on! All the cool kids are eating em! (chases after her.)
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther," And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we dont
just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," (sitting down next to Chandler) Im training to be better at a job
that I hate, my life officially sucks."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Look Rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you
wanted to do fashion stuff?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out
resumes like what, two years ago?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Well, Im also sending out.... good thoughts."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing
pushing you to get another one. You need the fear."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, The fear?
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go
after a job you really want."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why
dont you quit and get the fear?"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Because, Im too afraid."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,
y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still
working here."
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, Rachel?
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, Cant I just look at the handles on them?
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, You would think.
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know
why Im a terrible waitress? Because, I dont care. I dont care. I
dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the
tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do. So I dont think
I should do it anymore. Im gonna give you my weeks notice."
0,season3,310rquit,Gunther, What?!
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Gunther, I quit."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," (to Joey) Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for
coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, I spelled out boobies.
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," (comes up and starts looking through Rosss cookie supply) Ross,
but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint
treasures?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Ah, were out. I sold them all."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, What?
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Monica, Im cutting you off."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-its no big
deal, all right, Im-Im cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," So, how many have you sold so far?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Oh my God, how did you do that?"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser
Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I
ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They
call me"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," (entering) Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers,
I need stamp lickers....."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, Me! On my computer.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Well you sure used a large font.
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad
co-captain only took up so much room."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!
You wanna know what else is really funny?!"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, Something else I might have said?
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," I dont know, I dont know, werent you the guy that told
me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Sweetie, calm down, its gonna be okay."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," No, its not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I
dont have a lead. Okay, y'know what, Im just gonna, Im just gonna call
Gunther and Im gonna tell him, Im not quitting."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and
your fear.... "
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, No.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have
an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey."
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, Not a problem.
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, Thanks.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey, And now for the great news.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," What, that wasnt the great news?"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Only if you think its better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)
snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind
of Christmas lookie."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, Christmas cookie?
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now its a little more
money, but you get a nicer smell."
0,season3,310rquit,Guy, Looks good. Ill take it.
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you
dont want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead
tree she has)"
0,season3,310rquit,Guy, Its-its-its almost dead!
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Okay but thats why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil its
Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Yeah, the ah, trees that dont fulfil their Christmas destiny are
thrown in the chipper."
0,season3,310rquit,Guy, I-I think Im gonna look around a little bit more.
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," (entering) Hey, guys. Im here to pick out my Christmas tree."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this ones yours!
Ahhh."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica, Is this the one that I threw out last year?
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!
Im sorry, Im sorry, I didnt mean to get so emotional, I guess its
just the holidays, its hard."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," Oh honey, is that cause your Mom died around Christmas?"
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Oh, I wasnt even thinking about that."
0,season3,310rquit,Monica," Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a way-to-go thumbs
up and smile.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you
sell?"
0,season3,310rquit,Girl," Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke
Sarahs leg."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
0,season3,310rquit,Girl, Youre a big scrud.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Whats a scrud?
0,season3,310rquit,Girl," Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, I dont have too. I can just look at you.
0,season3,310rquit,Leader," All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies. (all the
girls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to
Debbie) Very nice."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, (to himself) Not nice enough.
0,season3,310rquit,Leader," Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, (to himself) Good for a scrud.
0,season3,310rquit,Leader," Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Thats crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the
salute)"
0,season3,310rquit,Leader," Whos next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, whos
feverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, Hi there!
0,season3,310rquit,Leader," Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you
bought an awful lot of cookies yourself."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....
nuget.... diffency."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old
sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," (to Rachel, whos entering) Hey! Howd the interview go?"
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand
interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) Thats not how that was supposed
to come out."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, This is the worst Christmas ever.
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the
coffee house."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," I cant! Its too late! Terry already hired that girl over
there. (points to her) Look at her, shes even got waitress experience. Last night
she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, That word was swans.
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my
Christmas."
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe, Oh! Oh my God!
0,season3,310rquit,Joey and Monica, (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youre the best!"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!
Youre kidding! Youre kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler," Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel, (hanging up the phone) I got the job!
0,season3,310rquit,All, Thats great! Hey! Excellent!
0,season3,310rquit,Phoebe," Oh, God bless us, everyone."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Here we go. Im serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts
humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
0,season3,310rquit,Ross, No. 
0,season3,310rquit,Rachel," Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I
ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, its
just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)
Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it
feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again."
0,season3,310rquit,Rachels Boss," Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna
use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, cause this parts tricky,
see some people use filters just once."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and
Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah
Tuttles Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump
up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in
tinfoil.)"
0,season3,310rquit,Sarah," Really Mr. Geller, you dont have to do this."
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by
for mission countdown!"
0,season3,310rquit,Joey," (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,
eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!"
0,season3,310rquit,Chandler, Im an alien. Im an alien.
0,season3,310rquit,Ross," Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joeys
head.)"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize
it. Show to everybody. Got it?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Um-mm.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the
card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a
little while) 5 of hearts."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Real magic does exist.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Wow.
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," I cant tell you that, no."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Ah, somebodys at the door on the ceiling."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Noo, thats our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Why dont you go up there and ask him to step lightly,
please?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica," I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there
to yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) Ill go up there, Ill tell him
to keep it down."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," All right, be my guest."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Good luck.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna
know how I did it, Ill show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you
didnt see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks
up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.
Here, Ill slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow
motion)"
0,season3,311crws,All," Oh, I got it."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs
and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the
rest is unintelligible)."
0,season3,311crws,Guy," (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," (muffled) Oh, thank you."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with
a little nouse at the end?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Honey, whats the matter?"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, I just saw Janice. 
0,season3,311crws,All, Oh.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she
looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them."
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke
up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed
me."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throw
a party for me."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Its Joeys birthday.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, its
supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," (entering) Hows that coffee comin, dear?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, I know!
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl
who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Op.
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan, Eh.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh, you got me."
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential. Well,
Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion. How does that
sound?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh, that sounds great."
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."
0,season3,311crws,Mr. Kaplan," (opening the closet door revealing that its full of tangled up
hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) Youre welcome."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," I know honey, Im sorry."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think
why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely
related to the field theyre interested in."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," (gives her a look) Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a
Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... I dont mind
paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,
the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
0,season3,311crws,Guy," Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Its not funny, this is actually my job."
0,season3,311crws,Guy," Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at
that Mannequins Plus."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend
here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
0,season3,311crws,Guy," Ah, just one other thing."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Yes?!
0,season3,311crws,Guy," I ah, I work at <i>Bloomingdales</i> and I might know of a job
possibility if your, if your interested?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
0,season3,311crws,Gunther, (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean youre going out on a date with
the noisy guy upstairs?"
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Well, hes very charming."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then
its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Well, youre just gonna have to try."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Joey, where are the <em>Jell-o</em> shots?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em
around..."
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Chandler!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Hello-dillillio!!
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Oh, somebodys feeling better."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, (to Monica) Take off your shirt!
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Oh my!!
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Yeah, <em>Jell-o</em> just like Mom used to make."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Hi!
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Hi! So Im out having lunch at Monicas and this guy starts
talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at <i>Bloomingdales</i> and
there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and
hes gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!"
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Wow!
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, I know!
0,season3,311crws,Ross," What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Uh-huh!
0,season3,311crws,Ross," And hes, hes a total stranger?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Yeah! His name is um, Mark something."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, What!?
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Well, Im just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, To be nice.
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," No, only for sex."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about
me?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," I didnt have to, because I was wearing my I heart Ross
sandwich board and ringing my bell."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Uh-huh.
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sisters," (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look
almost identical)"
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica," How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Hi Joeys sisters!
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!"
0,season3,311crws,Cookie, Hey. What are we drinkin over here.
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice."
0,season3,311crws,Cookie," No kiddin, thats the exact same drink I made myself right
after I shot my husband."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Wow. Okay, I dont know how to talk to you."
0,season3,311crws,Sister 1, (to Chandler) What cha doing?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer."
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sisters, Oh!!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily
anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments? (to
one of Joeys sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Hi.
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Isnt that great?
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good
guy."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I
actually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina. (walks away)"
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Thats excellent.
0,season3,311crws,Ross," (to Rachel) So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark
doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know,
thats true of any job."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, How ya feelin?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the
presents."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
0,season3,311crws,All, Woooo hoooo!!!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing. "
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Why, what happened?"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,
thats not the worst part. "
0,season3,311crws,Monica, What is the worse part?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, I cant remember which sister.
0,season3,311crws,Ross," (to Rachel) You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!
(points to Chandler) This is men!!"
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually
going to kill you dead."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe, How can you not know which one?
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, I mean thats unbelievable.
0,season3,311crws,Monica," I mean, was it Gina?"
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Which one is Gina?
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," No, no, no, thats Dina."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," (to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either,
dwha!!"
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe, We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red
skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, That was me.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly
friendly, and Im sorry."
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Thats okay.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Thats all right.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Thats okay.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!"
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Hey, Joey."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
0,season3,311crws,Joey, I just got off the phone with my sister.
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Ah, which, which one?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Mary-Angela.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Mary-Angela.
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Y'know which one was she again?
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled
around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that
true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister. "
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Its gotta be the first one.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Yep, Im in a tree."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Did he call? Did Mark call?
0,season3,311crws,Monica," No honey, Im sorry, but the weekends not over yet."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that
Phoebe?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, I guess theyre back from their date.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Music. Very nice.
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," So, how are you?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, I am good. I finished my book.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh yeah, whats it about?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, I dont remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Yeah, I do. (they both run out)"
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter
Ive ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hells a matter with you? How do
you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a
letter?"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France.
When actually Ill be in Cuba."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in
person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,
okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her
down easy."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Where in Cuba?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing
here?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Im here to see Mary-Angela.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,
listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two
yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on
Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Wheres Mary-Angela?
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Shes right in there. (motions to the living room)
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sisters," Hey, Chandler!"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," I cant believe Mark didnt call. Its Sunday night, and
he didnt call."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Bummer.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, youre practically giddy."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," No, Im genuinely sorry the Mark thing didnt work out. Look,
Rach, I want only good things for you."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Wait a minute, why dont you just call Mark. (they both look up in
shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, youve got to make
stuff happen."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," But, you, you dont want to seem too pushy."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," (to Ross) Honey, its not pushy, he gave her his home number."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As
in like, to, to his home?"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Yeah, and you dont mind if I call, because you only want good
things for me."
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Thats right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at
Monica)"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, its Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,
dont you apologize. (listens) Yeah, Ill hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my
number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, That is so made up!
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, its perfect. Oh
God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Yay!
0,season3,311crws,Ross, There you go.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Oh, that is amazing!"
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, Id expect nothing less."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, I got to figure out what Im going to wear.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, High collar and baggy pants say Im a pro.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Yeah! Right! Okay, Ill see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo
hoo!"
0,season3,311crws,Ross," You go get em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in
some way?"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, What?
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Why dont you call him?! Well, thank you very much!
Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically
remove the boyfriend!"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Are you crazy?!
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy
is taking my girlfriend out for a meal."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," What?! Ross y'know this isnt even about you! I mean this is about
Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if youre
right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
0,season3,311crws,Ross, No.
0,season3,311crws,Monica, I mean dont you trust her?
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Well, yeah!"
0,season3,311crws,Monica, Then get over yourself! Grow up!
0,season3,311crws,Ross, (shyly) You grow up.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?"
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Grandmother, No! I did!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?"
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Grandmother, Of course! Its her favorite.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite?"
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Grandmother, More of Grandmas teramisu.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is
great. Its top notch."
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Grandmother, That dies with me.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, So will I.
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister," Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything.
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister, (whispering in his ear) Just do it.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, (startled) Hey!
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister," Finally, I thought wed never be alone. Can I just tell
you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he
ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in
a, in a commitment kind of place."
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister," So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the
softest lips."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela."
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister," No, Im Mary-Theresa."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?"
0,season3,311crws,Mary-Angela, (standing behind Chandler) I am!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnt see Mary-Angela)"
0,season3,311crws,Mary-Angela, Joey!!!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!
0,season3,311crws,Joey, Whats goin on?
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, (pats him on the shoulder) Youre it! Now run and hide!
0,season3,311crws,Mary-Theresa," Its no big deal. Chandler was just kissin me because
he thought I was Mary-Angela."
0,season3,311crws,Joey," What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," I wasnt sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joeys
sisters gasp) Look, Im sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really
similar."
0,season3,311crws,Joeys Sister," I say, punch him Joey."
0,season3,311crws,All, Yeah! Punch him!!
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers not
going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youd
be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want
you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my best
friend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
0,season3,311crws,Cookie," So what. I say, punch him."
0,season3,311crws,All, Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
0,season3,311crws,Joey," No! No! No! No, Im not going to punch Chandler."
0,season3,311crws,Cookie, Ill do it.
0,season3,311crws,Joey," No you wont. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe
him, hes sorry. But, (to Chandler) youve got one more apology to make, all
right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Okay, absolutely!"
0,season3,311crws,Joey, All right.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler," Youve got it. (he starts to look at his sisters, but he
still doesnt know which one is Mary-Angela.)"
0,season3,311crws,Joey," Cookie, now you can punch him!"
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, What?! (Cookie punches him)
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Hi!
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, What are you doing here?
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Oh.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Hi. (kisses her)
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Hi.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Howd did it go?
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank
God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy
and wouldnt shut up."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Im so proud of you.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Me too!
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous
and, its just that I like you a lot, so..."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, I know.
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,311crws,Mark, Rachel?
0,season3,311crws,Rachel, Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
0,season3,311crws,Mark," Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the
job."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Oh, I did!"
0,season3,311crws,Mark, Yes.
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)"
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.
0,season3,311crws,Monica," So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?"
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe, Oh well y'know. (laughs)
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Yeah, I do know."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Ick, you were eavesdropping."
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," Oh, Im sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really
happens to like me."
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Maybe hes just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
0,season3,311crws,Ross, Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
0,season3,311crws,Joey," All right, thats it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy
is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)
But, is he a big guy?"
0,season3,311crws,Ross," Ah, well all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)"
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Thank you.
0,season3,311crws,Chandler, Dont worry.
0,season3,311crws,Phoebe," God, I hope they kick his ass!"
0,season3,311crws,Rachel," Honey, Im sorry."
0,season3,311crws,Monica," Y'know if its any consolation, he really did sound like he was
having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)"
0,season3,311crws,Guy, (muffled) May I help you?
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does
everybody hate these shoes? "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that
as long as your wearing that towel dress. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, (to Ross) Tell him. 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to
start with her! "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
"
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Why? 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,
y'know he's the botanist. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,
I'm here with the purses! "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down
there and I'll take you out to lunch? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to
Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Oh. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the
bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can
see a stripper. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a
magician?! "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all
right. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should
of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really
good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!
(pause) Don't cry outloud. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway
musical? "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," It is me! It's a musical version of <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. So I think
I'm gonna sing <i>New York, New York</i>, and ah, oh <i>I left My Heart in San Francisco</i>.
"
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, What? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Who? 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
0,season3,312towj,Joey, The what? 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, The abridgment. 
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what? "
0,season3,312towj,Mark," ...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date.
Good. Any questions so far? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? 
0,season3,312towj,Mark, Twenty percent. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call. 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," Here, let me. (answers phone) Rachel Green's line, how may I help you? "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," (on phone) Hi, is Rachel there? "
0,season3,312towj,Mark, And who may I say is calling? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, This is Ross? 
0,season3,312towj,Mark, Ross of..... 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Of Ross and Rachel. 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," Oh hi. It's, it's Mark. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Oh hey, hey Mark. "
0,season3,312towj,Mark," Hey, hold on a second. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Okay. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Hi honey! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh, he's just goofing around. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in
his own office? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two
assistants. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, What? 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.
(to Mark) Mark, I need you! "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.) "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Ow! Ross!! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing
another number. (hangs up) "
0,season3,312towj,Jeannine," (to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can
be alone with him. You'd better go for it. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Please, I'm not going for anything. "
0,season3,312towj,Jeannine," Well, if you don't, I will. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, Would you please go? 
0,season3,312towj,Jeannine, Night Mon. Night Julio. 
0,season3,312towj,Julio, (to Jeannine) Adios. 
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Look Julio, someone left their book here. "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Ah actually, that is mine. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Oh yeah, what are you reading? "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," I thought I would, but the translation's no good. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I
can't believe I just said that.') "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Actually I ah, I am a poet. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write
about? "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this
lip. (points to her lip) "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here? 
0,season3,312towj,Julio, I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip) 
0,season3,312towj,Monica," How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a
handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Lovely, just lovely. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Really? Thanks. 
0,season3,312towj,Director," Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on
Saturday. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Excellent, I'll be there. "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance
audition. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your
dance background it'll be a piece of cake. "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the
American Ballet Theater?! "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids
either. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Well, can you dance at all? "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Oh no, no, no, no. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that? "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?
(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that
you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?
(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, (entering) Hi! 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even
sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to
write a poem. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am
like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
(hands them the poem) "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe, Oh yeah. 
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
(tries to take the poem) "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," Whoa, I'm not done. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, Bye-bye. 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," What, what, what?! "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My
vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, You really think that is what he meant? 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Done. 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," (reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play
the theme from Love Story) "
0,season3,312towj,Mark, Wh-what's that? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," It's from Ross, it's a love bug. "
0,season3,312towj,Mark, Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's
just really romantic. "
0,season3,312towj,Man," (to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Yes. 
0,season3,312towj,Man," (being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three... "
0,season3,312towj,Quartet," (singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It
won't be long before your the boss. "
0,season3,312towj,The Bass Barber," Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah. "
0,season3,312towj,Quartet," (singing) And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one
and only boyfriend... "
0,season3,312towj,The Bass Barber, It's nice to have a boyfriend. 
0,season3,312towj,Quartet, Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you
any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, All right Ross!! I get it!! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, I mean my God... 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, You're hurt! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office
anymorrrrre!! "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your
territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, I would never do that! 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He
said this is what you guys do. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Mark's a genius! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her
right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to
complain about you. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, What am I going to do? 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did
that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few
surprise visits. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, I don't know you guys. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,
meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she
starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And
he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be
like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And
we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler, He paints quite a picture doesn't he? 
0,season3,312towj,Woman, (walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December. 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," (turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her) "
0,season3,312towj,Woman, Mark!! 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," It's okay, Rachel knows. "
0,season3,312towj,Woman," Yeah, but even soo. "
0,season3,312towj,Mark," I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee) 
0,season3,312towj,Mark," Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just
so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on
no one's around, just, just kiss me. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! "
0,season3,312towj,Mark, What is going on? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, (now standing behind Ross) Ross! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand
on her shoulder and she knocks it away.) "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a
call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long
Island. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," So, does that mean the audition is off? "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to
take these dancers and show them the combination. "
0,season3,312towj,Joey, What?! 
0,season3,312towj,Director," Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very
quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand
sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. "
0,season3,312towj,Director, Have fun. 
0,season3,312towj,Joey, Bye. (does the jazz hands) 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe, (entering) Hey! 
0,season3,312towj,Monica, Hey. 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe, What are you wrapping? 
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Yeah, it's a vase. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Yeah, just like the one in the poem. "
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe, Well not exactly like the one in the poem. 
0,season3,312towj,Monica, What do you mean? 
0,season3,312towj,Phoebe," Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
"
0,season3,312towj,Monica," (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? "
0,season3,312towj,Julio, What? 
0,season3,312towj,Monica," Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't
write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my <i>People</i> magazine
comes on Saturday, and the new <i>Hold Everything</i> catalog. Y'know but that does not
mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no
right to make that kind of judgment about me. "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Whoa, whoa, whoa. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, You don't even know me... 
0,season3,312towj,Julio," Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, What? 
0,season3,312towj,Julio," The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you
would think this. "
0,season3,312towj,Monica," I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... "
0,season3,312towj,Julio," No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? "
0,season3,312towj,Monica, (sarcastically) Oh yeah. 
0,season3,312towj,Director," All right, let's do it! "
0,season3,312towj,Director," No, no, no. What was that? "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," I know, it was the best I could get out of them. "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Well, people! "
0,season3,312towj,Joey," People, people, people. "
0,season3,312towj,Director," Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
(to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,
she's fully dressed, right? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Right. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you
click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,
she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just
stares at him.) "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, (entering) Hi. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Hello. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, A big idiot. 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda
hard for me. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
"
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if
it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not
gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. "
0,season3,312towj,Gunther, Let it be me! Let it be me! 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people
love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she
kisses him) "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you
pick me up some porn? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Where ya going? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Ohh, with who? "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?! 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Yeah. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, You have a play date with a stripper?! 
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.
And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree
class. Why, is that okay? "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Sure, is she married? "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Ahh, no. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel, Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Are you jealous? 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I
mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, You are totally jealous. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain
things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... "
0,season3,312towj,Ross," Honey, I love you too. "
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. "
0,season3,312towj,Ross, What? 
0,season3,312towj,Ross, Huh. 
0,season3,312towj,Rachel," (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of
hours, y'know. "
0,season3,312towj,Chandler," Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a
stripper. "
0,season3,312towj,Man, (entering) Is there a Julio here? 
0,season3,312towj,Julio, (to him) I am Julio. 
0,season3,312towj,Man," (singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think
there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. "
0,season3,312towj,Quartet," Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just
a buttmunch. "
0,season3,312towj,Bass Singer, No one likes a buttmunch. 
0,season3,312towj,Quartet, And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!. 
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, (to clerk) Hi.
0,season3,313maraf,Clerk," Six dollars, please."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
0,season3,313maraf,Clerk," Eight oclock is the cut-off and, (looks at his watch) aww,
its 8"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, youre gonna
have to help me out here, cause I only have three."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," (standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Hi!
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," So, you look great."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Right.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, No you do. You... just...
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, What?
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Youve got panties stuck to your leg.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," (removes them) Thats because I-I was just grabbing some things out
of the dryer, and its static cling. Or maybe its just that God knew Id
be running into you and saw an opportunity."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Its good to see you.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Its good to see you too.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we
leave hes going straight to the porn."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Hes gonna go up to the counter with <i>Citizen Kane</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>,
and Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Yeah.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, I missed this.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Me too.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," No, I just I think that its too soon."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Yeah, baby!"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, What are you doing?
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, No thanks. Im 29.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Oh sweetie, when do you think youre going to get off tonight?"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Oh I dont know honey. Its gonna be really late.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Oh come on, not again."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," I know. Im sorry. Look, Ill make a deal with you all right?
Okay?"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Hmm.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, For every night that youre asleep before I get home from work...
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, I will wake you up in a way thats proved very popular in the past.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Right.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi."
0,season3,313maraf,All, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like
y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal thats hes
going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, And what are you going to do for him?
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Im going to let him.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Cool.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, (entering from her bedroom) Morning.
0,season3,313maraf,All, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Somebody got in late last night.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Yeah well, I ran into Richard. "
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, When did this happen?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Oh, um, around 8"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Oh, theres no such thing as an innocent burger."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," So, are you gonna see him again?"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Tomorrow night.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Monica, what are you doing?"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now
shes celebrating that by going on a date with him."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Its not a date, okay. Im just gonna teach him how to make
lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably be
hungry after the sex."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Were not gonna have sex! Okay, nothings changed here. He
still doesnt want children and I still do, so thats why were just gonna
be friends."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Naked friends.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Do you have any ice?
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Check the freezer. If theres none in there, then were probably
out. Are you just getting in from work? Its late."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the
meeting with the reps from <i>Calvin Klien</i>. I told my boss I liked this line of
lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, I discovered Im able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of <i>The
Shining</i> in your freezer?"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," But ah, youre safe from it if its in the freezer?"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading <i>The Shining</i>,
without making sure weve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, How often do you read it?
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Havent you ever read the same book over and over again?
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Well, umm, I guess I read <i>Little Women</i> more than once. But I mean
thats a classic, whats so great about <i>The Shining</i>?"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," The question should be Rach, what is not so great about <i>The
Shining</i>. Okay? And the answer would be"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Okay. Ah, well well just see about that, okay. I will read <i>The
Shining</i>, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesnt want to let it
go) and you will read <i>Little Women</i>. "
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," All right, you got it."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, All right.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Oh, hey."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Hi.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," (to Robert) Youve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).
Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Oh.
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," (to Robert) So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts?"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Well, Im from California."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," (standing up) Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now!
Anybody ah, want anything?"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Ill have coffee.
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Yeah, me too."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Yeah, make that three."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Okay Ross, why dont you come with me?"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter
with you? Whats going on?"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, Roberts coming out.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, What?!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, The man is showing brain.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Are you sure? (Chandler nods
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Coffee.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, We could write it down for you?
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," No, no, that wont be ah, that wont be necessary (leans down
and looks up Roberts shorts, seeing Roberts package.) "
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, (to Ross) Wellll?
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, What do we do? What do we do?
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, Like an eclipse.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," You say Thank you very much, and then you buy me something
pretty. Come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna start
squishing the tomatoes."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Ew, this feels very weird."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, You touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish
them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) Thats my hand."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Oops.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Gotta keep squishing.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Tomatoes are squishing.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Op.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. "
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Yeah.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it
should umm, be..... "
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, What?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Umm, youve got some on your pants."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Ill just throw them out.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, These little women. Wow!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Your liking it, huh?"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jos manuscript. I dont see how he
could ever forgive her."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Umm, Jos a girl, its short for Josephine."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," But Jos got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean
its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from <i>The
Shining</i>."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," No, actually Lauries a boy."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Hey! Howd the ah, basketball go?"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a
twenty-three pointer."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, You mean a three pointer?
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Oh, I get more because Im dainty."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock. "
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his
side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)
Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, Im Joey, we havent met."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Ah, good to meet you. Robert."
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You
not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Calm down. Theres no reason to get testy.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, You guys!! Come on!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt
as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, What do you mean?
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Hey. (sits down)
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Sure.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," So, howd the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe
me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.
(listens) I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) Its a word!"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Yeah, I do think its better this way. (listens) Yeah, were
being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, Im sure.(she opens the door
and its Richard)"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, You really sure?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Ill call you back. (starts kissing him)
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, So we can be friends who sleep together.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you
currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Just your dad. (pause) Although thats actually racquetball. You
know I-I do have a blind date with my sisters neighbour next Tuesday."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Oh.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, You want me to cancel it?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, No! (pushes him) No! 
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, and
were just friends."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Exactly. (pushes her back)
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Hey. Ooh! Dont sit down! 
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, You ready to go to the batting cage?
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Yeah. And, first heres a gift."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Oh! Wow! Hey!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I
were you I would wear them every day, every day!"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I
dont think I can wear these, theyre so tight, I feel like Im on display.
Im sorry."
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Thats all right, thats well, I figured.... (they start to
leave as Joey enters.)"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, (to Joey) Hey!
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Hey! (starts to laugh.) Hows it going?
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Good.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Hey, Rach, how you doing with <i>The Shining</i>?"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Oh, Danny just went into room 217."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Oooh, the next parts the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub..."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on youre gonna ruin it!"
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," All right Ill talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the
kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Hmmm, thats very cool."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,
no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they
get away. Aww!"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Joey! I cant believe you just did that!
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler, I cant believe she cracked your code!
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though
shes still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy."
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel, and kills the dad."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Eh. Beth dies.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Beth, Beth dies?"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Um-hmm.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, What?!
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Joeys asking if youve just ruined the first book hes
ever loved that didnt star Jack Nicholson?"
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, No. She doesnt die.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Then why would you say that?!
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Because, I wanted to hurt you."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, (gasps) Oh my....
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, Got em.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Hi.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. Im
sorry."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top
it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her
left breast.) in a grill fire."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, What are you smiling at?
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel," Im sorry, I was just thinking youre day could still pick up."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Yeah, right."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Hello.
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, I love this friend thing!
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Listen, Roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you just
tell him?"
0,season3,313maraf,Ross, Oh.
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it
on the lose? Is it watching me?"
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his.... stuff."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," Hes right, even if its to say something complementary. (He
stops and thinks about what he just said.)"
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, (entering) Hey! 
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? Theyve got this new rock
climbing wall, we can spot each other."
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," No, I can spot you from here."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert, What?
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Okay, listen Robert..."
0,season3,313maraf,Ross," (to Chandler) Hey, dont we have to..."
0,season3,313maraf,Chandler," Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," Umm, I think youre really, really great..."
0,season3,313maraf,Robert," Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads
his legs) Is it something Im putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?"
0,season3,313maraf,Phoebe," I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say."
0,season3,313maraf,Gunther," (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,
put the mouse back in the house."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Ow!
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, its just like everyone
elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
0,season3,313maraf,Richards Date," Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me
the tour."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as
Richard starts the tour.)"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Ah well, this is the living room."
0,season3,313maraf,Richards Date, Impressive.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, All right. This is the kitchen.
0,season3,313maraf,Richards Date," Oh, thats real pretty. Wait a minute, dont I
get to see the bedroom?"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical... (opens the door
as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the
room.) bedroom."
0,season3,313maraf,Richards Date, Were still on this side of the door.
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, Um-hmm.
0,season3,313maraf,Richards Date," Yeah, but I didnt get to see it."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows
her out)"
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called
and switched it to today."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And Im just
asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Well, you seem fine."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," (gets up) Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not. I mean how
can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)
Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?"
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, You mean like exclusive friends?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so
terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood
up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Wow. Y'know were back where we were. Honey, I would love to do
all that, but nothings changed."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Thats not true, you dont have a moustache."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard," Okay, okay, one things changed. But we still want different
things and we know how this is gonna end."
0,season3,313maraf,Monica," Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, cause
getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I dont think I
could do it again."
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, I know I couldnt. So....
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, How bout one last game of racquetball?
0,season3,313maraf,Monica, Watch the thorns!
0,season3,313maraf,Richard, (lying down) Ow!!
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, What?
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Beth is really, really sick."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Awwww.
0,season3,313maraf,Joey," Jos there, but I dont think theres anything she could
do."
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Joey?
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
0,season3,313maraf,Joey, (nodding his head) Okay.
0,season3,313maraf,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,314pexp,Singer," (singing) Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but
fall from grace. I know....."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, Wow! This girl is good.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that
before."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, I like her.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at
the same time?"
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these
people."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know,
shes more..(shakes his shoulders, like hes dancing) y'know, and youre
more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)"
0,season3,314pexp,Singer, (singing) beside meeeee-eeee-ee. (everyone applauds her).
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done."
0,season3,314pexp,Singer," Okay, my next songs called"
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs."
0,season3,314pexp,Singer, Hey Phoebe.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Hey Leslie, howd you know Id be here?"
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said
you played here a lot, so umm...."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the
place with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several big
fish or just one big fish."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Ah, yeah, umm. (singing) Home is never far away.."
0,season3,314pexp,"Monica, Ross, and Joey", (joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Yeah, but, I dont do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and
then I couldnt come up with anything good, so they fired me."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Hmm, bummer."
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that
umm, maybe youd want to get back together?"
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, No. But thanks.
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie, Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Okay. No. But thanks.
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. (leaves)"
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once
you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. Very cold, hard, unyielding,
y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a
tissue, please?"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Yeah, sure."
0,season3,314pexp,Gunther, (to Chandler) Someone in there?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called
wait until the last moment before I burst and die."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Jeez, man did you fall..(sees its a beautiful woman coming out
of the mens room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
0,season3,314pexp,Woman," Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up
for ya though."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im
talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say
your name."
0,season3,314pexp,Woman, Ginger.
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so.... "
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Dont you have to use the bathroom?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. (pause)
Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)"
0,season3,314pexp,Gunther, Someone in here.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Wheres Chandler?
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!
(hides behind the coat rack.)"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Joey? Joey Tribbiani? 
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Phew, close one."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Hi, sweetie!"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Hello. 
0,season3,314pexp,Mark," Hi, Ross."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Yeah, huh. "
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Ive got some bad news.
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, What?
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Come on sweetie! Youve had to work late every night for the past two
weeks, what is it this time?"
0,season3,314pexp,Mark," Actually, its kinda my fault. I-I quit today."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but thats sad
about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?"
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Nooo, hes leaving for a better job."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Oh well thats great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.
Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachels desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye."
0,season3,314pexp,Mark," Okay, then."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Well were gonna miss you around here.
0,season3,314pexp,Mark," Yeah, me too."
0,season3,314pexp,Mark," So, see ya on Saturday."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Yeah, you bet."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the
oven)"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.
Thats the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?"
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our
Moms worked on the barge together."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, You never run on a barge!
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe and Monica, Hey.
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Is ah, is Chandler around?"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, Oooh.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Yeah, Ginger something."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like
Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,
(singing) the movie star."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Aww, man. Thats the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out
hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Well, what did you do?"
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I cant, I cant tell you that,
its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Y'know what, dont tell us. Well just wait until Chandler
gets home, (to Phoebe) because itll be more fun that way."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone
out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dads cabin. Just me,
her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic
dinner...."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, You gave her food poisoning!?
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of
the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.
So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably shouldve told you
about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, I ran!!
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive
ever met in a mens room."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Actually, me too."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in
a puddle."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Oh damn, I hate that."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Oh, dont worry about it."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," No, really youre gonna freeze."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," No, Im not."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Some day, maybe."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Funny book?
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Umm, Mark, Mark saying Ill see you Saturday."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you
didnt mind."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Oh, no, no, no, its-its not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Oh, please tell me its not because Im going with Mark."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Oh, well..."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Oh my God!!! Ross!!
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Well, Im sorry, but ah, look if youre not working with him
anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Because, hes my friend."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with
Mark?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff
with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Really!?
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you
know I could be a fashion..... monger."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried
look on his face) What?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," What should I wear, now Im all nervous."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt
called. Not that I even care, y'know."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, You think you know me so well.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Well, dont cha wanna?"
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Okay, well I do know you."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, Thats what I said.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Well so?
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," I cant. I cant. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her
and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. Y'know what the saddest part
is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like
all my lives."
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at
the heel, holes in the toes. Dont care what people say. My feets best friends,
pals to the end. With them Im one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light,
I...."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe, (singing) I stepped in something icky.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe and Leslie," (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time Ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee."
0,season3,314pexp,Lecturer," Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and
colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink...."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," (to Rachel) Im really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)
Youre so pretty. I love you."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,
smelly cat, its not your fault."
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Wow, thats great."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Oh, yeah!"
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a
kitty litter campaign."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie, What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by
now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats
really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside
down to play it.)"
0,season3,314pexp,Lecturer," ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories
in general are very popular now."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, (entering) Hi!
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milks gone bad."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking,
great personality, shes greatness."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Uh-huh.
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it
did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its
like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest
person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, (entering from his bedroom) Morning.
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, (to Monica) Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin huh?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, It came up.
0,season3,314pexp,Joey," Listen, I ah, I know its a longshot. But, by any chance did she find
that funny?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, (entering) So I nodded off a little.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My fathers boat didnt
make that much noise when it hit rocks!"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about
strappy backed dresses."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium
listening to Professor Pitstains and hes Hey everybody! Remember that thing
thats been dead for a gazillion years. Well theres this little bone we
didnt know it had!"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," First of all its Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little
bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didnt fly."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Okay, see now, what I just heard"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I
wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Oh, that is so..."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an
unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake
it off, thinking its alive and attacking him.)"
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with
me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldnt go with Mark?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," No. I... I wanted to be with you. I dont know, I feel like lately, I
feel like youre slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new
people, and youve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know its dumb, but
I hate that Im not a part of it."
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Its not dumb. But, maybe its okay that youre not a
part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean its like, I-I-I like
that youre not involved in that part of my life."
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Thats a little clearer.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel," Honey see, it doesnt mean that I dont love you. Because I
do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work its-its for me y'know,
Im out there, on my own, and Im doing it and its scary but I love it,
because its mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ross," Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Your thinking about my leg arent you?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Its okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need
to know is"
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, No. No. I dont think so.
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Okay. Its just like anything else, you just have to get used to
it."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Whats that?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, Thats-thats my nubbin.
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, Whats a nubbin?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger, You have three nipples?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...
(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
0,season3,314pexp,Ginger," Ah well, its nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, Ill see you
later. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone
runs their fingernails across a blackboard.)"
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you werent coming. What? Where were you?"
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,
dont get mad, okay."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Okay, dont give me a reason to get mad, okay"
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, and
you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably
wouldve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I
cant trust you then just forget it. "
0,season3,314pexp,Leslie," No, no, I dont want to forget it."
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important
thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but
we wont be partners. So whats it gonna be?"
0,season3,314pexp,Commercial," (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the
litter box? Dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Sorry, Pheebs."
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, Yeah. You okay?
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-lifes gonna had you all
kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a
new song?"
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Wed love too.
0,season3,314pexp,Phoebe," Okay. (singing) Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle
whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell. Thats all I have so far."
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," (entering, happily) Well hello!"
0,season3,314pexp,Joey, Where have you been?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler, The doctor.
0,season3,314pexp,Ross, Is everything okay?
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no
waiting."
0,season3,314pexp,Monica, Wow! Its like Rachel in High School.
0,season3,314pexp,Rachel, What?!!
0,season3,314pexp,Monica," Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
0,season3,314pexp,Chandler," That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it.
Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of
olives?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," I wont give you anything, but youll owe me 2.95."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, Done.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages
outside the UN and, I dont know where his country is."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Okay, lets start with the free messages outside the UN."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Oh!! Thats my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what
country is this guy from?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Ick-neck-tree-anis..... Theres a g in there.
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Wheres that?
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, In your atlas!
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, I dont have an atlas.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Oh, but wait I do have a globe."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Hold on.
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, So Pheebs whats this guy like?
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Umm, well hes very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very
sophisticated, and he doesnt speak any English, but according to his translator, he
totally gets me."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, What is this?
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Its a globe and, a pencil sharpener."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going down
to the Xerox place."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Oh, no thanks."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down
there?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the
belly button ring again?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, Yeah! You wanna come?
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, Yeah!
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come
on Chloe!!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Issac, (to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, Uh-oh.
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copying
needs. And well need a little more time to think about it."
0,season3,315rrtb,Issac," Chloe, switch with me, theres some guys here that got a crush on
you."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe, Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning.
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Well ah, ........y'know."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe, Maybe. Does that scare ya?
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Relax. Its just Issacs D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should
come."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, Well be there.
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Great. Ill ah, see ya then."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10 sign, then hides his
face in shame.)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei, (something in Russian or Polish)
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," Hes says, Walking with you makes this strange city, feel
like home."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So thats dumb what I
said, dont tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and
Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, (leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, (leaning in) He would like to kiss you.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you dont! (Mischa tells
Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moments over."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, Oy!
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Wow! Its small.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way
across it."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," So you had fun, huh?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Yeah. Except for, y'know when youre on a date and youre
getting along really great but the guys translator keeps getting in the way."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, No.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe and Monica, Hey.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," What is ah, Rach in her room?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Oh no, shes still at work, but she told me to tell you to call
her."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?
Doesnt she know its our anniversary?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Whats that on the bottom?
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Oh thats my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)
Shes fancy."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, (answering her phone at work) Hello.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Hey, honey."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh, hi."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Hey, whats going on?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Well, there was a disaster in shipping and Ive got to get this
order in. Honey, Im so sorry, but it looks like Im gonna be here all night."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," No-no-no, no, honey please, Ive got, Ive just have so much
to deal with."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," (to Monica) Anyway, Im going out with Sergei again tonight, and
um, could you come and be the translators date? So that when we, its time for
our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, hes really, hes kinda cute."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your
friend Spackel Back Larry?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Hey, dont call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did
Chloe say we should be there?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Uh, 10"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, What time is it now?
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, 4
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Yeah all right, so well hang out."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, Yes. Vividly.
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, She was kidding about that right?
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,
I-I think so..."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Dude, I dont know."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, She was kidding.
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up
with a set of ground rules."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your
eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see
something you dont want to be seeing."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are
closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab
something with his hand.)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...
(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this
with you."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (on the phone) No, no, no, Im looking at a purchase order right
here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and
colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what Im wearing?! Can I please speak
to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) Were holding."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Well you said you couldnt go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the
basket)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Sophie," You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. Thats it, on Monday I
start wearing make-up."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah, but I got cous-cous!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Honey, honey, Im sorry, I know its our anniversary but I
told you on the phone I dont have time to stop."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Okay, you dont have to stop, Im invisible, Im not here.
(lights a candle)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," But I dont, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!
(listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the
phone!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Sophie, I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Yeah!!
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is
not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this
store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, (stopping grinding) Pepper?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, (angrily) None for me.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Okay sorry, whew."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Im sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and Im
sorry but thats... (notices a fire that Rosss candle has started) Oh my God!! "
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, thats a
fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (on phone) Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you
back, Ive got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Im sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how
bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, I dont have ten minutes!!
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would
you just go home, Ill talk to you later. (storms out) "
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah, but wait..."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, Good bye!
0,season3,315rrtb,Sophie," Actually, thats our three hole punch."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Hey.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to
me."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring
a picnic basket to somebodys work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our
anniversary, boy what an ass am I. "
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," But I told you, I didnt have the time!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even
have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my
job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," No, but itd be nice if you realised, its just a job!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, Just a job!
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Yes.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life Im doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life Im doing
something that Im actually good at. I mean. if you dont get that..."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And Im happy for ya,
but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
dont know what to do anymore."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, Well neither do I!
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Is this about Mark?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Okay, its not, its not."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, youre, youre, youre making this too hard."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Oh Im, Im making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," I dont know, I dont know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Okay, okay, fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a
break, (goes to the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got
in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71. "
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," (seeing Ross enter) Hey, its the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross)
Hi, Ross."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Oh, hi Chloe."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and
Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said
we dont do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime
anybody wants 400, we just say lets Ross it!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, And thats the only colour that comes in.
0,season3,315rrtb,Issac," Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe, Oh! (storms off)
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big
anniversary dinner."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, were gonna break-up instead."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,
knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros
Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, He says he was too.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Interesting.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa, (to Monica) So I was wondering....
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please
tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks
you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a
chef?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," Oh, really."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What
are you doing?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Well, I was having a conversation."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent
been able to say two words to each other."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a
conversation?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, That would be great. Thank you.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," Oh, hi. Its Mark."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, (disappointed) Oh.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark, What? Is it my breath?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isnt tonight your,
your big anniversary dinner?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Yeah. Well, umm....."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," Rach, are you okay?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (on the verge of tears) Yeah, Im fine."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese
food."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark, Its for me.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh. Okay, bye."
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey, So what are you gonna do?
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to
wait a while?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler," Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chandler, Why? What happened to him?
0,season3,315rrtb,Joey," Nothing, hes just really believes in that."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted
to take a break, I dont want to take a break."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark, Wow. Im sorry. Eggroll?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasnt there."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," Well, then hes, hes probably just, out."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over."
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, Hello.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Hi! Its me.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont,
dont you think we can work on this? "
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark," Hey, what do you want to drink?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Whos that?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel, Nobody.
0,season3,315rrtb,Mark, Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, Is that Mark?
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Ah, thats okay, thanks."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance."
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him) "
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away,
while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica, Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you dont accidentally suck
it up through your nose and choke on it."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Well, tell him, apology accepted."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," (to Monica) Oh, hes unbelievable. I mean for the first time in
three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let
me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why dont you learn some English,
Sergei?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Excuse me, but umm, isnt he paying for your dinner?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," Hey, the mans dog just died."
0,season3,315rrtb,Mischa," (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons."
0,season3,315rrtb,Monica," It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your
guy cant even say coupons. (they leave)"
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei," Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Plate! Yes, plate."
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei, Plate. Plate. Plate.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," See, we dont need them."
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei, (picking up a cup) Plate?
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross, (to Chloe) I like this song.
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe," Well, youre practically dancing already. Why dont you just do
it over here?"
0,season3,315rrtb,Ross," Oh, no, no."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe, What? Are you married? Cause thats okay.
0,season3,315rrtb,Rachel," (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be
home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, youre not home."
0,season3,315rrtb,Chloe, Still no smile?
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei," (singing) Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. (stops to correct
Phoebe) Ameri-ccan."
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe, Ameri-can.
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei, Ameri-ccan.
0,season3,315rrtb,Phoebe," Ameri-can. Y'know its a very hard language. Lets do
it again."
0,season3,315rrtb,Sergei," (to the rest of Central Perk) Everybody!! (In his language, and
continues.)"
0,season3,316toama,Joey, (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve
got a girlfriend?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Is this about Mark?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Okay, its not, its not."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,
urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a break, (goes to
the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
(opens the door)"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, No. A break from us.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a
break, I dont want to take a break."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," (on the phone) Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont,
dont you think we can work on this? "
0,season3,316toama,Mark," Hey, what do you want to drink?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Whos that?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Nobody.
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Is that Mark?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? Cause thats okay."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Hey.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Hey.
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Hows the big anniversary dinner?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Well, we never actually got to dinner."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Ohhh, nice."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," No, we kinda broke up instead."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and
fruit flies everywhere.)"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica its on the ceiling."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Thats okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on
my ceiling! You broke up?!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Yeah, but its okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Oh no!! 
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, No.
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Rachel, you and Mark?!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," No, no-no, its okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised
how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to
make it work."
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, (entering from bathroom) Morning!
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," (on answering machine) Hi, its me. Ive been trying to reach
you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and
Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. "
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Yeah!!
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Eh, Im just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I
dont want to get back together over a machine."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Na-huh.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," So, I love you."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, I love you.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," And y'know what, Im gonna, Im gonna go to bed now, but ah,
on my way to work tomorrow morning, Im gonna stop by around 8"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Bye.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Chloe, Chloe hows it coming?!!"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," (entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should
get?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Umm, oh, hey, I dont know. How about a big one?"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, But my apartment is so...
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Well then a small one!! Listen, lets, we kinda have to get going!"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, Wait! Wheres my shoes?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down
and picks up a shoe)"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, Do I know why were rushing?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(Hes frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! "
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, Thats so great for you guys!
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Yeah! 
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, You must be so happy!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yes, yes I am, one of the many things Im feeling. Well.... (picks up
her coat)"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," Good luck, with your girlfriend. "
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yes, you can, very much."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Hey.
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Oh, theres banana on it."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Oh, good. Thanks."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Now what is Fabutec?
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Okay, all right dont judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this
info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,
except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so
amazing...."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Waxine!!
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Yes! Have you seen it?
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, I know!!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do
that?"
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!"
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, They have the best stuff in there.
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Oh my God! Oh my God!
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to
make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?
Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I
can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell
her what I did."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question. How dumb are you?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," What?! Look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How
am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,
just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just
gonna hurt her."
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah, but dont you think...."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait
until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the
footrest extended.)"
0,season3,316toama,Joey," All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out
some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about
the trail?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, What trail?
0,season3,316toama,Joey," (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs
sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes
friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!"
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one, "
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Did that!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull
it off in one quick pain free motion."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Was it not pain-free?
0,season3,316toama,Monica," No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont
seem to think its that bad."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so
stupid. But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (entering) Chloe? Hi.. 
0,season3,316toama,Chloe, Is this about me taking your watch?
0,season3,316toama,Ross, You took my watch?
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," Im sorry, I do that."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?"
0,season3,316toama,Chloe," Oh, well I tell Issac everything."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we
havent actually met..."
0,season3,316toama,Issac, You dog!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her."
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em,
monogamy is too cruel a rule."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. Were
the same, you and me."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Actually, no, were not."
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Yeah, we are."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," No, were not."
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Yeah, we are."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," No, were not!!"
0,season3,316toama,Issac," Okay, were not."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Right.
0,season3,316toama,Issac," But, we are."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Fine. I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.
0,season3,316toama,Issac, I can promise not to tell her again.
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (entering out of breath) Jasmine? 
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine, Uh-huh.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," We met at Phoebes birthday party, Im, Im Ross Geller."
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine, You did a bad thing!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Yes, I did."
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine, Very bad!
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Very bad.
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine," Very, very bad."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Im agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe
yet?"
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine, No.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Okay, Jasmine, please, please dont. I love my girlfriend very much,
and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine, All right.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Thank you, thank you."
0,season3,316toama,Jasmine," But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he
knows Phoebe too."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (angrily) Whos your roommate?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
0,season3,316toama,Gunther, Im sorry. Was I not supposed to?
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Ow!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Oh!!
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Ow!! Ow!!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Ow!!!
0,season3,316toama,Monica and Phoebe, Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Were all right.
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Its okay, its okay."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Were all right.
0,season3,316toama,Monica, We were just waxing our legs.
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Off?!!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless
youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,
thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joeys arm and puts a
strip on it.)"
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Oh, thats mature."
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Thats right.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, I cant talk to you. I cant even look at you right now!
0,season3,316toama,Monica, What?
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Nothing, nothing."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Rachel?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Just get away from me!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Whe-where did he put it?!
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Ross, you had sex with another woman!"
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Oh my God.
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and
you didnt tell us?!"
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! "
0,season3,316toama,Ross, No!!
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
0,season3,316toama,Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Uh-oh.
0,season3,316toama,Ross, What?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Was she good?
0,season3,316toama,Joey, Dont answer that.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk
about it!! How was she?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, She was...
0,season3,316toama,Joey, Awful! Horrible!
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
0,season3,316toama,Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," She, she was different."
0,season3,316toama,Joey, Ewwwww!
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Uh-oh.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Good different?
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Nobody likes change.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Should we do something?
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Im sorry, okay, Im sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,
and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,
and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend
leave? (Ross cant answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She
was in there, when I was in there?!"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I
thought we were broken up. "
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, We were on a break!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, You think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Look, Im not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our
relationship was dead!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!"
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Y'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to
open the door)"
0,season3,316toama,Monica," (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You cant go out there."
0,season3,316toama,Joey, Why not?! (to Chandler) Im hungry.
0,season3,316toama,Monica, Because theyll know weve been listening.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to
make sure that didnt happen!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all over
again."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more
important things to worry about."
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Yeah, well be fine."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, were never leaving,
ever."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Hi, its Phoebe. Listen someones gonna have to take my 9"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I
didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," All right. Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been
able to forgive me?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (pause) Yes I would.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked
with me, and made love to me?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross, (less sure) Yes.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,
okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because
its, I mean its you."
0,season3,316toama,All, Ohhhhh!
0,season3,316toama,Ross," What? Come on Rach, tell me what youre thinking?"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Order a pizza like, I forgive you?"
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic
message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, We could eat the wax! Its organic.
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Oh great, food with hair on it."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," No, not the used wax."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Because that would be crazy?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because Im kinda hungry myself."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza."
0,season3,316toama,Ross, No anchovies.
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," With ah, extra anchovies."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Thats okay, Ill just pick em off."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in
the sauce?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," You can have the last piece, if you want."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Well, I should think so. You slept with someone."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Theyre gonna get through this, arent they?"
0,season3,316toama,Chandler," Yeah, come on, its Ross and Rachel, theyve got too."
0,season3,316toama,Monica, What if they dont?
0,season3,316toama,Joey, You think I need a new walk?
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, What?
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school.
Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I
need a take notice walk."
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Are you actually saying these words?
0,season3,316toama,Ross," What, now youre not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee
table) Look Rachel, I-Im sorry, okay, Im sorry, I was out of my mind. I
thought Id lost you, I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane
must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I dont cheat right, I,
thats not me, Im not Joey!"
0,season3,316toama,Joey," Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come on
look.) Yeah, okay."
0,season3,316toama,Monica," Hey. Its three in the morning. They dont know that Ive
come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am."
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe," Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Y'know what, y'know what, Im-Im not the one that wanted that,
that break, okay. Youre the one that bailed on us. Youre the one that, that
ran when things got just a little rough!"
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Thats....
0,season3,316toama,Ross, Thats what?!
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, That is neither here nor there.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Okay, well here we are. Now were in a tough spot again, Rach. What
do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do
you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And Im sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I
cant. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just cant see us
throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Dont! You cant
just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesnt work
that way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Okay, okay, okay."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, (softly) I think you should go.
0,season3,316toama,Ross, What?
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, (softly) I really think you need to go now.
0,season3,316toama,Ross," (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said
there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together..."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," Yeah, what the hell did I know!"
0,season3,316toama,Ross," Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,
(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life
without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your
face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her
waist) and, and...."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel," (crying) No. I cant, youre a totally different person to me
now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now
I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant, (Ross stands up and backs away)
it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. Its just changed,
everything. Forever."
0,season3,316toama,Ross," (crying) Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean."
0,season3,316toama,Rachel, Then how come it is?
0,season3,316toama,Phoebe, Theyve been quiet for a long time.
0,season3,316toama,Joey, Maybe she killed him?
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, Lets go.
0,season3,316toama,Chandler, (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
0,season3,316toama,Joey," (whispering) No, I really have to pee."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Can I see the comics?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, This is the <i>New York Times</i>.
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Okay, may I see the comics?"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, We are. Hes meeting us here.
0,season3,317towst,Monica, No! Rachel is meeting us here.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Oh come on, they can be in the same room."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Why? What happened now?
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over to
borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to
borrow something."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Wait. Why was he yelling at her? Hes the one who slept with
someone else. "
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,
that she should of forgiven him by now."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what
he means. Oh my God, this is like <i>60 Minutes</i>, okay, when, when, at first
youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know
you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.
Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they
never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, I had the same dream!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. "
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Oh, I had the opposite dream."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been a
week."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Yeah, I mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Its never taken you more than a shower to get over a
relationship."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," (seeing her) Okay, lets go!! Lets hit the road!!"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Hey!
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Lets get the show on it! 
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Closer than here?
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found
coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, lets skedaddle."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay, your highness."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel Im really sorry.
(imitating Rachel) Thats okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)
Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, (softly) Is he here?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, No.
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Oh. (smiles) Heres your moisturiser. Hi! 
0,season3,317towst,Monica and Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five
tickets, <i>Calvin Klein</i> lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (theyre
all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans
with Ross."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Oh, well okay. Well, there you go."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," No, its just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he
wants y'know, us to check it out."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Hm-mm.
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show
times on his answering machine."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Ohh!
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Were sorry honey.
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Oh, its okay. (starts to leave)"
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Rach, its, its ah, its not that we dont want to,
really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, And heels.
0,season3,317towst,Joey," (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,
Chandler mouths Come on!) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and
we set that night aside."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, thats only fair. (leaves)"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Ohhh boy, do I feel bad."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Oh yeah.
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Very bad.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Chandler what are you doing?!
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Chandler!!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Youre smoking again?!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im,
Im smoking still."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which
is when I started smoking in the first place."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Werent you nine?!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after
nap time...."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Him? Him, Ross?"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got
divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and
its Rachel again.)"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my
sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.
Huh? Im asking you first, right?!. I mean Im playing by the rules."
0,season3,317towst,All," Absolutely, yeah!"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!!"
0,season3,317towst,Joey," (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can
cut glass over here!"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Wait. Really?! Cause mine get me out of tickets.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending
this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say
thanks."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon
okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an
Irish accent) Two days of darts, itll be great!"
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Itll be great for next weekend.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Itll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)
itll be grrreat."
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Whats going on?
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachels
sisters cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," So, for the whole weekend?"
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Were really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Yeah, thats okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for
the first weekend Im alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Y'know what, I can stay, Im gonna stay. Cause the last time
I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your
grandmothers cab, but y'know what, Ill stay."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Noo! Ill stay. Hes my brother.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, What a pity stay?
0,season3,317towst,Monica, No! Were gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any
of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," (to Joey) Well hes probably mad after you called him this
morning to borrow his goggles."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, What? Mine arent tinted.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Chandler!!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, What?
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, What does the sign say?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, Beam me up Jesus.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my
Grandmothers cab."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
0,season3,317towst,All, Oh!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Please!
0,season3,317towst,Monica, No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I
really have to goooooooooo."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Oh, now I have to go!!"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, What?
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Ow!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (to Rachel, whos staying in the cab.) Arent you gonna go?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, No. Thank you.
0,season3,317towst,Monica," (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no
tissue, no tuschy. (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybodys going.
(She gets out and starts to close the door.)"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," No, y'know what dont close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking
themselves out.) cause the... keys...are in there."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Whats going on?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, (to Joey) My lighters in there! (points to the cab)
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, Damn! (stands up) The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put
it on this morning."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," So, if youre parents hadnt got divorced, youd be able
to answer a question like a normal person?"
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys
give me the underwire from your bra!"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, What?!
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, What?!
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Please!!
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the
biggest wire."
0,season3,317towst,The Girls," No, not getting my bra!"
0,season3,317towst,Joey," If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay, Monicas are the biggest."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, its gotta be Rachel."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually
sometimes, st-stuff my bra."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," All right then, your bra would still be big."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," No, I stuff outside the bra."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take
off Monicas bra."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right
there."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and
save us."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass."
0,season3,317towst,Joey, (opening the door) And there you go!
0,season3,317towst,All," Oh, yeahhhhh!!!"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Chandler!!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, At least let me smoke it to the good part.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," What, whats it, whats going on?"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Yeah, this has happened before."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, So you know how to fix it?
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Yep. Put more gas in.
0,season3,317towst,Carol, (answering the door) Hi! 
0,season3,317towst,Ross, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Hey, what are you doing here?"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you
get the tape that was half the last episode of <em>M*A*S*H</em> and half the hostages
coming home?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming
home."
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Wheres Ben?
0,season3,317towst,Carol, Hes sleeping.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its
kinda an anniversary."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol, Its not that kind of anniversary.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Ah! (realises) Oh.
0,season3,317towst,Carol, Sooo!! Anyway...
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. Cause you
know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so
Rachel and I broke up."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Oh God, Ross I am so sorry."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Yeah, well."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should
probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh yeah, Id love that."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Oh, great! Me too."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the
table.)"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Great!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Yeah, what town are we near?"
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route
were on?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)
There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we
drove up here."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check
every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they dont do
that."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a
half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here! "
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, But if...
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to
think of something else."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, So the going for help went well?
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another
cigarette.)"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Then why are you smoking?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, Well its very unsettling.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," ....right? Right? I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they
just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I dont, I dont need
them, huh, Ive got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Ah, Susan will be so pleased."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Wheres 717? (He gets up to
return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross
grabs the last piece.) Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, I ate a bug.
0,season3,317towst,Monica," (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a
penny. Lets stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so
we cant get a tow truck."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh, now you want a favour?"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Yes, please."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little
too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got
home safely okay?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe,
hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," No, Im not gonna pick them up."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not
a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or
save us both time and sulk in the car."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," No, Rachel doesnt want me to...."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love
with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Yeah, youre right."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens)
What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms
down) yeah. Where are you? Ill find you. (hangs up)"
0,season3,317towst,Carol, You slept with another woman?
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh, you-youre-youre one to talk."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Okay, done."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, (reading the sign) Whats pleh?
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Thats help spelled backwards so that the helicopters can
read it from the air!"
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Huh. Whats doofus spelled backwards?
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees its Ross) Ugh!!!"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Oh, its Ross on one of his drives!"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler and Joey, Hey!!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, What is he doing here?!
0,season3,317towst,Ross," He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course Im stepping on
some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, Ive got plenty of people to help
on the Interstate."
0,season3,317towst,All, No! Come on!
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, All right!! Fine! Fine.
0,season3,317towst,Joey, Arrrghh!!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who
drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then
gonna go skiing?"
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
0,season3,317towst,Monica," I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Ask me what?
0,season3,317towst,Monica," Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
0,season3,317towst,"Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey"," No, I wasnt gonna ask you that, no."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Excuse me?
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, Its horrible.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," (sarcastic) Oh please, cant I come to your special, magical cabin?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Why would you even want to come Ross? Youre a horrible skier.
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
0,season3,317towst,Monica, Here we go again.
0,season3,317towst,Joey," I-I cant handle this, you guys."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually
its the ah, middle part of my first name."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," All right Pheebs, your cabs ready."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," All right, lets go!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Youre welcome.
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Oh, Im sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone
else?"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, We were on a break!
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," Y'know Ross why dont you put that on your answering
machine!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Hey-hey, its valid okay? And Im not the only one who thinks
so, Monica agrees with me."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, (to Monica) What?!
0,season3,317towst,Monica, (shyly) I dont know.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Thats what you said last night.
0,season3,317towst,Monica," What I said was, was that I understood. Joeys the one who agreed
with you!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Really Joey?
0,season3,317towst,Joey, (pause) What?
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel," No, I think its very obvious whos wrong here."
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Obviously not to Joey.
0,season3,317towst,Joey, (pause) What?
0,season3,317towst,Ross," (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.
No-no-no-no."
0,season3,317towst,Chandler," Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to
stop the fighting.)"
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues
to dance.) Look what youre doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and
Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts
to leave) You dont, all right you dont have to love each other, okay? You
dont, you dont even have to like each other much right now. But please, you
have to figure out a way to be around each other."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Yeah, and not put us in the middle."
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Yeah, otherwise, I mean thats, thats, thats just it
for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you
be civil?"
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, I can.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Okay. Good, all right, lets get back in the car, cause
its freezing, and my chest is unsupported."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Whos going
with who?"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross
cuts him off.) No, Im, you, you planned this all out, and I dont want to ruin
it, so you guys should just go."
0,season3,317towst,Joey," Come on man, you drove all the way up here."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," No, no, really, Ive got to take the car back anyway, Im
spending all day tomorrow with Ben, Its fine, no guilt I promise."
0,season3,317towst,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season3,317towst,Monica," All right, well call you when we get back."
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. 
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe," Or, or the rodeo!!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, That would be great.
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Okay!
0,season3,317towst,Chandler, I was being Shelly Winters from <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>.
0,season3,317towst,Ross, I know!
0,season3,317towst,Phoebe, Bye!!!
0,season3,317towst,Carol, (looking through the peephole) Ugh. (opening the door) Ross!
0,season3,317towst,Ross, (entering) Hi! Sorry Im late. Were you sleeping?
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Ahh, nooo!!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the
best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp."
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Youre a genius, Ross."
0,season3,317towst,Ross," Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even
110?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow. (pushes him out the door)"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Okay, bye!!"
0,season3,317towst,Ross," So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,
y'know?"
0,season3,317towst,Carol," Yeah, okay, bye. (closes the door, turns out the lights, and runs back to
the bedroom)"
0,season3,317towst,Ross, (outside the door) So Im gonna take off then!
0,season3,318towht,Monica, (to Joey) Whats so funny?
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Oh, nothing, no. Its an acting exercise, Im practising my fake
laugh."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Oh. (she laughs)
0,season3,318towht,Joey, What-whats so funny?
0,season3,318towht,Gunther," (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
0,season3,318towht,Gunther," Okay, but only if you give me a drag."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Okay.
0,season3,318towht,Gunther," Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler
back the cigarette.)"
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," No-no, why dont you hang on to that one."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Okay, thats like the least fun game ever."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that
is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)"
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking
patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake
laughs.)"
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Come on, its a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two
weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since."
0,season3,318towht,Ross, Pffhah.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, (to Ross) Whats your problem?
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of
three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have
to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Or what my Father called Thursday night.
0,season3,318towht,Ross, Here you go.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Oh, y'know what, I didnt want cinnamon on this."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his
hand.)"
0,season3,318towht,Frank, (entering) Hi!
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Oh my God!! 
0,season3,318towht,Frank, Hi!
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Frank! Hi!
0,season3,318towht,Frank, How are you?
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, What are you doing here?
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Oh, well y'know, I wouldve called but I lost your phone number and
then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldnt find it. And then, I tried
to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So..."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, What happened?
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Well, we got into a fight cause ah, she said I was to immature to
get married."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Your getting married?!
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Oh, yeah!"
0,season3,318towht,All, Wow!
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, My little brothers getting married!!
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Oh, I knew youd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you
want to meet her?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Do I?
0,season3,318towht,Frank, Do you?
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, I do, yeah."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) Im
gonna, Im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!"
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one
of us to get married."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, isnt it fantastic?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young to
get married?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," What, hes 18."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Exactly, itll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party."
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Yeah, or-or to get a hooker."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Always illegal Joe.
0,season3,318towht,Frank," (entering with his fiancée Alice, who is obviously much, much older than
he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)"
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Y'know it-its funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your
not how I pictured you at all."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, Im a big surprise."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," So, um, how-how did you guys meet?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knights ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I
always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class."
0,season3,318towht,Alice, And he was my best student.
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Yeah, she was my best teacher. "
0,season3,318towht,Alice, Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?"
0,season3,318towht,Ross, And so now you guys are gonna be married?
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to
have kids right away."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Oh my God!! Great!
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure youre ready for that?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who
doesnt want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah,
now-now I always will, cause y'know, itll be me. Right?"
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference
between us."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?"
0,season3,318towht,Hypnosis Tape," You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now
completely asleep. You dont need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone
out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you
gotta get me back in the game."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all
I meet are eligible straight men."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?"
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given
em out."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Havent you and I covered that topic?
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,
and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times
we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with
me, dont you?"
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean
that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. That wig all in
disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. "
0,season3,318towht,Monica," I mean really, think about it."
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Ho-ho, I will."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," No, I know, I know, that this is Franks life, (walks behind them,
they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I dont want to
be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!"
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," No-no, oh, Im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts
sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat! "
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to
his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not
fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and
it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics."
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Yes. Not out loud.
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and
then youre gonna hate yourself."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, but if I do tell him, then hes gonna hate myself. I mean
look at him and his Mom, I cant. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk
him out of it."
0,season3,318towht,Ross and Joey," No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,
and turns them back to face her.)"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.
Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!"
0,season3,318towht,Ross and Joey, No.
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. (exits)"
0,season3,318towht,Joey," So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,
Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? And then, and
then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place.
Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. "
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Nah, he doesnt do anything for me."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on <i>Walker"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.
(realises) All right, I get your point."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, All right.
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Hey.
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just
carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Uh, yeah."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?"
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Y'know what, pretty good."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and
confident, that is a stunning blouse."
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Here you go.
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Thanks
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems
really nice, and that check thing was adorable."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, What check thing?
0,season3,318towht,Monica," As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000
tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete (quickly grabs a magazine
and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Thats Bill Clinton.
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, Whos he huggin?
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that
program!"
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, We use it!!
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, There you go!!
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire. "
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Im not gonna go out with him.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is
just so exciting."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Or incredibly offensive.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel," Oh yeah, sure, that too."
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
0,season3,318towht,Ross, All were saying is dont rush into anything.
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Yeah, come on, think about it. Youre 18, okay, shes 44, when
youre 36, shes gonna be 88."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," What, you dont think I know that?"
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Look, the point is, theres a lot of women out there you havent
even had sex with yet!"
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Yeah, he-hes right, hes right. This is your time y'know, yeah,
youre young, youre-youre weird, chicks dig that."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Okay, but isnt sex better when its with one person that you
really, really care about."
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Yeah, in a poem maybe."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," No the mans right, thats what I had with Rachel."
0,season3,318towht,Frank, You dont have it anymore?
0,season3,318towht,Ross," No, I ah, I slept with someone else."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?"
0,season3,318towht,Ross, It didnt.
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with
Alice."
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Now, wh-what, what is that like?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being
with her is so much better than like not being with her."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Yeah, yeah."
0,season3,318towht,Joey, (to Ross) Why cant I find that?
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!"
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Well, I want it!"
0,season3,318towht,Frank, You can have it!
0,season3,318towht,Joey," I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres
something wrong with me."
0,season3,318towht,Ross," Oh, no! No!"
0,season3,318towht,Frank, Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
0,season3,318towht,Joey, Then you hold on to it!!
0,season3,318towht,Frank," All right, man!!"
0,season3,318towht,Joey," All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, (to Joey) Youre Franks best man?!
0,season3,318towht,Joey," I couldnt help it, there love is so pure."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!"
0,season3,318towht,Ross, Im the ring bearer.
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. Im so glad you could come, cause
Ive got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge
mustard stain on it.)"
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Oh my God, who died on this?!"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Absolutely. Okay, first well start with a little club soda and
salt, and then if that doesnt work we can go back to"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Y'know what, forget it. Its ruined. "
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Oh no-no, never say that. If we cant get it out then we can cut
around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Okay, thats great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on
the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin."
0,season3,318towht,All," Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay."
0,season3,318towht,Secretary, You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Hang on a second. (to the employees) Ill-Ill talk to you in
the morning. (turns two of the three off) Im sorry what?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Well, yknow, I never know how much to tip."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Youre supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I
mean, whats-whats the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?"
0,season3,318towht,Employee," Umm, Im still here."
0,season3,318towht,Pete," (turns off the TV) Youre taking this all wrong. Because, if I
didnt leave you that tip, you wouldnt of come down here, we wouldnt be
having this argument, and there wouldnt be this ah, heat between us."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, What?!
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new
level now. Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now
were like this-this couple that fights."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Okay, umm, youre a loon."
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think
youre great. Come on, what do you say?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica, I dont know.
0,season3,318towht,Pete, Why not?
0,season3,318towht,Monica, Cause I dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
0,season3,318towht,Pete," One meal! Thats all Im asking for. Please? We go out, we eat,
and if you dont have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no!
Just put the mail down. Its-its me!"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought
Id curl up in it. Is that all right?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Oh, well just probably the worst one since Ive been alive."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," What umm, what happened?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I dont
see how I could all of the sudden be too young, cause Im older than I was when
we first got together."
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, no, I dont, I dont know. But, y'know what, maybe
its just all for the best?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)"
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!
After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and
then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, its still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now
its, and now its gone and I dont know why!"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Uh, well I can tell you why. Its, its because of me. But,
y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
0,season3,318towht,Frank, What?
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made
her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. And youre gonna see it to,
one day, you really, really will."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Well, you, wait no, my Mother didnt want us to be together, but the
worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. "
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Okay, but."
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought youd
understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or
a place to go"
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Oh my God! The millionaires here!
0,season3,318towht,Chandler, (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him
anything."
0,season3,318towht,Monica, I know!!
0,season3,318towht,Chandler," Okay, then get the lobster!"
0,season3,318towht,Monica, (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
0,season3,318towht,Pete, Hi.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Hi!!
0,season3,318towht,Joey, Hey!
0,season3,318towht,Ross, Hi!
0,season3,318towht,Joey," Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (starts
to leave) Bye."
0,season3,318towht,All, Oh-no-no-no-no.
0,season3,318towht,Rachel, Just one drink?!
0,season3,318towht,Monica," (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?"
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Hey, you like pizza?"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Oh, thats sounds great."
0,season3,318towht,Pete, I know a great little place.
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!"
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is
that enough lire?"
0,season3,318towht,Pete," Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that."
0,season3,318towht,Monica," Why, how much is that?"
0,season3,318towht,Pete, Thats about 60 cents.
0,season3,318towht,Joey, Every night!! 
0,season3,318towht,Hypnosis Tape," You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who
does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally
evil thing, but I so didnt. Theres someone here who can explain this better
than I can."
0,season3,318towht,Alice, Hi Frank.
0,season3,318towht,Frank," Hi, Mrs. Knight."
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Phoebes right Frank. I know its hard to hear, but it
wouldve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,
we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that
what it is?"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Yeah, but not just that."
0,season3,318towht,Alice," Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we
do, none the less"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe, None the less.
0,season3,318towht,Alice," None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you
want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)"
0,season3,318towht,Phoebe," Thats right, exactly. (sees them) All right, its a good bye
kiss, thats good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They
both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that
you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore
her) Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my
purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves)."
0,season3,318towht,Hypnosis Tape," Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong,
confident woman, who does not need to smoke. "
0,season3,318towht,Joey," (Hes recorded his voice on the tape) Joeys your best friEnd.
You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants. "
0,season3,319tiny,Gunther, Here you go.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season3,319tiny,Gunther," (In his head) <i>Say Rachel, I was wondering if youd like to go
to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe youd just like
to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.</i>"
0,season3,319tiny,Mark, (entering) Hi!
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Mark," Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh, okay."
0,season3,319tiny,Mark," Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But
since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it. But, now that youre
not, Id really like to ask you out sometime. So-so thats-thats what
Im doing, now."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Wow! Umm....
0,season3,319tiny,Gunther, I dropped a cup.
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," ...so y'know, thats why, within a few years, that voice recognition
is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be
like-like, Wash my car. Clean my room. Its not gonna be able
to do any of those things, but itll understand what youre saying."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Oh, this is so great."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," Yeah, it was."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly
kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Hello, people who do not live here."
0,season3,319tiny,All, Hi! Hello!
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, I gave you a key for emergencies!
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe, We were out of <i>Doritos</i>.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold
separately."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes so
funny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Still?!
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like
the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from <i>Sharper Image</i>?
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, Two.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old
baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table
and exits)"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
0,season3,319tiny,Monica and Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you."
0,season3,319tiny,The Director, Joe. Hows it going?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast
member.) Hey."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Hi.
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, so youre playing Adrienne, huh?"
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. Im Joey Tribianni."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. "
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," So the ah, plays pretty great, huh?"
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murrays work. Shes so
brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle
class."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Where do I know you from?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Dr. Drake Remoray. <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Voted most datable
neurosurgeon by <em>Teen Beat</em>."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," No, thats not it. So, youre a soap actor? Well this must be
pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Hey, Ive done plays before. Im a serious actor."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!
Youre-youre-youre the guy that doesnt know how to pour milk!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I
couldnt. Now, see, thats acting."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Yeah, that was real."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe, Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, I know.
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe, Huh.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," I mean I think Id say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this
Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean Im
standing there with this charming, cute guy, whos asking me to go out with him,
which Im allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like Id be cheating on Ross
or something."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, youre not over Ross yet and
you have issues with your father."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, I dont have any issues with my Father.
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Okay, so its probably just the Ross thing then."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about
that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and
whenever I cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, (entering) Hello.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler and Joey, Hey!
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without
me.... a-sucks."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I
broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Then be supportive like a guy.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, Id miss you."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," You ah, wanted to see me?"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Yeah. Ahh, heres a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, What?!
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh, y'know, its just like hats, and a shirt, and CDs, just
sort of stuff that youve left here."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know its time we-we y'know,
move on. I mean, I mean dont you think?"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Yes. 
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Yes, I do."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Good.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this
was a gift?!"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Its still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Okay, all right, give me the mug! Ill keep the mug."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," No!! Y'know-y'know dont do me any favours. In fact, where,
wheres the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this
book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? Id like that back too.
Yes, I do."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that
T-shirt!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Im just trying to help you, move on."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty...."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Petty...
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Petty... (goes into her room)
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Petty...
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Petty...
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Petty...
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Small...
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking
her.)"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, You are so just doing this out of spite.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Huh?
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Im-Im gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he
kisses the shirt)"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesnt even
fit you anymore!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on
the T-shirt. Its an old Frankie says relax T-shirt, that barely fits
him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you dont mind Im
gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a
pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)"
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, And youre our age. Youre our age.
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name
it after yourself."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete, What like Pete Dakota?
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Thats not a state Joe.
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later."
0,season3,319tiny,All, Okay.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Youre our age!
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?"
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head
and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, Im running
out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I
only attracted to guys where theres no future? Either theyre too old, or
theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me,
and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! I mean,
seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!"
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Yeah, kinda."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and nothin. You look
at me, and its nothin. (He kisses her) Nothing."
0,season3,319tiny,The Director," Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a
history, its-its nice."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, I have a question about this scene.
0,season3,319tiny,The Director, Yes?
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor."
0,season3,319tiny,The Director," Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than
that."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, its says so in the script! Y'know
ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script
here that youre a bitch."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, It doesnt say that in the script.
0,season3,319tiny,Joey, It does in mine!
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I
still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing
on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, You bug me.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Is there any chance you didnt see that?
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the
peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say
no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, You didnt just break up.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Hey, its been like three weeks!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I
mean bullets have left guns slower!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,
Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this. (turns away,
then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,
shes going in."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Okay.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The
doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Stop what?!
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," I dont know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will
do it. Ill go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, No!! You cant!! 
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Look, they must be stopped!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!
(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly
strong!"
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, I need juice! People need juice!!
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Look man!
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, People need juice!
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the
door shut with his feet.) "
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Juice, I need..."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna
be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you
are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?
Its over."
0,season3,319tiny,Ross," Yeah, okay. "
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Okay. 
0,season3,319tiny,Ross, Its just I miss her so much.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, I know. (He rubs Rosss head) 
0,season3,319tiny,Mark, Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is
missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Y'know what?
0,season3,319tiny,Mark, No. And I dont think Im gonna want to.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, I cant do this.
0,season3,319tiny,Mark," Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
Im just doing it to get back at Ross. Im sorry, its not very fair to
you."
0,season3,319tiny,Mark," Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am
here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.
Right here!"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, Oh God. Im sorry about this.
0,season3,319tiny,Mark, Thats okay.
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, You sure?
0,season3,319tiny,Mark, Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
0,season3,319tiny,Spokeswoman," ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so
today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is
truly ironic, on one hand consider the size..."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?"
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, Sure.
0,season3,319tiny,Pete, Where are we? 
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, Im gonna
say, midget rodeo."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete, Just tell me the truth.
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Okay. Umm, y'know, I dont think, I dont think I told you
this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," Oh, yeah. Wasnt that like a year ago?"
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. Umm,
the thing is that, right now Im just in a place in my life where I need to focus on
me. Y'know what I mean?"
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," Oh, yeah. I know that."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, I so wanna be attracted to you.
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," But youre not. Okay, good."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, Im sorry.
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," Y'know what, dont be. This is not, dont be, cause
its not so bad."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, Its not?
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," I know Im no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone
who find attractive, Im just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling
differently."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Well, um, look I-I dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, you
seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasnt attracted too."
0,season3,319tiny,Pete," Yeah, stupidly charming isnt it? Well listen lets, you
wanna get something to eat? Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start
to leave)"
0,season3,319tiny,Spokeswoman, And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
0,season3,319tiny,Pete, (to Monica) One second.
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a
gunfighter in a Western.) "
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," (to Joey) I wasnt doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing
his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the
greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so
talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so
good."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Im talking about you. You big, big freak."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you
were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!"
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and its nothin.
You look at me, and nothin. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing."
0,season3,319tiny,The Director," You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up
here, tomorrow."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Well, that was ah..."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey, Better?
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. Gnight."
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Ah, Kate? "
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Yeah?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," You ah, you forgot your shoes."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," (she giggles) Im probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some
more)"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Hey, listen you ah...."
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Hmm?
0,season3,319tiny,Joey, ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Umm.
0,season3,319tiny,The Director, (leaning in) Kate?
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Yep.
0,season3,319tiny,The Director, You ready to go?
0,season3,319tiny,Kate, Yeah.
0,season3,319tiny,The Director, (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)
0,season3,319tiny,Kate," So umm, Ill see you tomorrow, huh?"
0,season3,319tiny,Joey," Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isnt it
Spiderman? Yknow like Goldman, Silverman..."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, Cause its-its not his last name.
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe, It isnt?
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man.
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," Hey, Rach, how was work?"
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair."
0,season3,319tiny,Monica," By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. Im just gonna throw it
out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)"
0,season3,319tiny,Monica, Something wrong?
0,season3,319tiny,Rachel," (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take
a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)"
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler, What about things that are already gold?
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Ahh, his work is done."
0,season3,319tiny,Chandler," Okay, lets play my game now."
0,season3,319tiny,Phoebe," Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick
up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the
only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what its like to be you?
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Oh, you have no idea. And-and when were on stage I get to-to kiss
her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like
somebodys ripping out my heart!"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,All, Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, We were all pretty shaken up about it.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Wait, am I missing something though? Cause I thought death was
something thats supposed to be sad, in a way."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to
Ross) And Im sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, You get the dollhouse.
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, I get the dollhouse!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," No, just a barrel."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, Really?! Really?!
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to
play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Hey, Sophie!"
0,season3,320towdh,Sophie," Hey, Rach!"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,320towdh,Sophie, Hey.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all
the way back up here."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to look
around her office.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Honey um, honey, you do realise that we dont keep the womens
lingerie here in the office?"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Yes, I realise that."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Rachel, I need the <em>Versachi</em> invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You
dont work for me."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)
Joanna."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Bing! Thats a great name.
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done.
So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Me too.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Bye, Chandler."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," (to Rachel) So ah, whats wrong with him?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Oh, nothing, hes just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice
it anymore."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," No!! No! Hes not married, or involved, with anyone!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Well, Ill ask him for you, if you want me too?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something
that Sophie would do?"
0,season3,320towdh,Sophie," Uh, uh, uh, I am here."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, I know that.
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay.
Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, Hello.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, I know!!!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," So, Im here, ready to play."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, Okay.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She
removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the
house.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, Whats this?
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Thats a dog, every house should have a dog."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, Not one that can pee on the roof.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive
waste."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," No, no, thats the ghost for the attic."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, I dont want a ghost.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house
is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,All, Hello.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, I need to talk to you!
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Sure, whats up?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about
you..."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin
out the Chan-Chan man!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you
interested at all?"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, shes gonna love me."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the
house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)
Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!"
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-thats it, thats it, all
right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? Theyre not the right size,
theyre not Victorian, and they just dont go."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, were not
welcome in the house of no imagination."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Uh, Pheebs, while were hovering around the subject. I just have to
say dinosaurs, they-they dont go, rrroof!"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, The little ones do.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Hey, Kate!"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate, Morning.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last
week..."
0,season3,320towdh,The Director," Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was
good, yeah..."
0,season3,320towdh,Woman," Hi, oh, Im Lauren, Kates understudy."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani."
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, I know! I-Im a big fan of yours.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," (looks at her, shocked) What?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on
<i>Days of Our Lives</i>."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Get out of here, really?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, Absolutely!
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Yeah? 
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, They gave me the shaft all right.
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," (laughing) Oh, youre so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing
after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a
drink sounds great."
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, Cool! I-Ill see you then.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, All right.
0,season3,320towdh,The Director," All right, its time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and
Kate just look at each other.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, Hey! 
0,season3,320towdh,All, Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Wow!!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing
the interior.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Hey, whats this?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Oh, okay, its the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides
a doll down the slide)"
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Its very interesting, Phoebe."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Whats this?
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come
over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, This is the coolest house ever!!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some
incense)"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, All right!
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, I would!
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross and Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the
house.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross and Rachel, Ooohhhh!!
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross and Rachel, Ahhhh!!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," (entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening. "
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Hmm.
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because
Joannas such a big, dull dud!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Chandler is fantastic!!
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, What?!
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Oh God, we just clicked! Yknow how people just click? Like he came
by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Oh, I...."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good
heart?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Oh, I know..."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to
call, so put him straight through."
0,season3,320towdh,Sophie, Isnt this great?!
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Dont spoil it.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?"
0,season3,320towdh,The Director," (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! Its you. Just ah, just
one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that
there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing
to the moment! (He goes to take the call.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, (to Kate) That guys like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater
youre dating."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Hey, Im not interested in her sweater! Its whats
underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who
Im going out with?"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," I dont care. Why, do you want me to care?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Do you want me to want you to care?
0,season3,320towdh,Kate, Do you?
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, What?
0,season3,320towdh,The Director," (returning) Okay, Im afraid to say this, but lets pick
it up where we left off."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate, Ive got no reason to stay. 
0,season3,320towdh,The Director," Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a
terrible play! Ill see you in the morning. (exits)"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," I cant believe we go on in, in a week."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Hey, its gonna be all right."
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," (to Joey) Hey! So since were getting off early, do you want to go
and paint mugs?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, What?
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, You know! At the place I told you about last night?
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," Oh, okay."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, Ill see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Okay.
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren, Gnight. (exits)
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, I dont know.
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Well umm, maybe if it had more heat."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, How do you mean?
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Well, Adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor cant
just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist."
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his
stomach!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this
raw, animal...."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Something like that?
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Yeah, thats pretty much what I had in mind."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, (to Ross) Hey.
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, (to Monica) Hey. 
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Its a little early to be drinkin.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Ohhhhh!
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, Youre kidding?! Thats great!
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making..."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, Oh my.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in
and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep
going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like hes been
processed by the devil, or something.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," (entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it all
wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime.
Ill give you a call."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, Thats what you say at the end of a date.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing
there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her
and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt
mean hes going to call. Hasnt it ever happened to you?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Well, they always called."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Hmm, bite me."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, (entering) Did he call?
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, No. Sorry.
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
0,season3,320towdh,Sophie," Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he
called, Rachel? Why?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Well...
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt
tell him not to call me, did you?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, No. I...
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you
work for, there are always ways to fix...that."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Multiple, so many paper cuts."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand.
Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out,
shes gone crazy!"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you
havent called her. You have to call her!"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say,
In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop
thing in the corner of her eye!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her
out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I
dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an
hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody
ever again!"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Thats fine!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, I know.
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Mon?
0,season3,320towdh,Monica, (from the bathroom) Im in the shower!
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Oh, fire! There, theres a fire! Fire!!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,320towdh,Kate, Hi.
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you
ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate, About what?
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Y'know, about what happened with us."
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Nooo. And theres really no reason he should find out, so ah
lets not make a big deal about it, okay?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you
cant tell me last night didnt mean something to you. I-I was there,
youre not that good an actress."
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. Thats all it
was. Joey, Im-Im sorry you feel bad, but havent you ever sleep with a
women where it meant more to her than it did to you?"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey, Nooo.
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," (entering) Hi, Kate!"
0,season3,320towdh,Kate," Hi, Lauren."
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," Hi, Lauren."
0,season3,320towdh,Lauren," Hi, pig!"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower
massager."
0,season3,320towdh,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a
fire."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What
happened?!"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the
point of origin.) In the Aroma Room."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe, All right. Did everyone get out okay?
0,season3,320towdh,Monica," Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate."
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to
remove it.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Ross," No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under
there!!"
0,season3,320towdh,Phoebe," (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets! "
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here,
(points to his eye) and its all the time."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Well, thanks again for lunch."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was
pleasant."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," It was, wasnt it?"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," The food there was, was great."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, Wasnt it?
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, So take care.
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, You too.
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it again
sometime. (Rachel is disappointed) "
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Great! Im looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?"
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Sophies desk.
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, Noo! 
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel, Chandler!!
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
0,season3,320towdh,Rachel," Okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now.
(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)"
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler, AhhhhIm not going to call you.
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, What?
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was
going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this
isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it
comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And
Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna," Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I
have to appreciate your honesty."
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Yeah, o-okay."
0,season3,320towdh,Joanna, So...
0,season3,320towdh,Chandler," Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again
sometime!"
0,season3,320towdh,Joey," (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve
considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. Ive ah, Ive
recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. So, do
you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and
crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.
Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, shes not home huh? (listens) Well ah,
actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Oh my God, they took my idea!"
0,season3,321pets,Monica, That was you?!
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)"
0,season3,321pets,Gunther," (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa. "
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
0,season3,321pets,Gunther, Are you all right?
0,season3,321pets,Joey," (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is
moaning in pain.) Oh my."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, (sporting a goatee) Hey.
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.
(theres no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You
should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here
crying all day about Kate."
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincys theory.
Okay?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (triumphantly) Im gonna be on TV!!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, No way!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Yeah! Theyre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils
they just found in Peru and <i>The Discovery Channels</i> gonna film it!"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Thanks. You ready to go?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Yeah. (they start to leave)
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Saw a girl with that vest.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
0,season3,321pets,Anchorwoman," (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as
traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is
intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys
wont live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little
baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead."
0,season3,321pets,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? Cause I
was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Hi!
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to
skate over to him)"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Wow! Skates! 
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece
of paper. So how was youre trip?"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh, whatd ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel
toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some
coffee?"
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Yeah, sure, thatd be great."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Ah, which ever is closest. "
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Okay. (hands him a cup)
0,season3,321pets,Pete, So ask me what I did today.
0,season3,321pets,Monica, So what did you do today Pete?
0,season3,321pets,Pete, I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
0,season3,321pets,Monica, What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven
and opened Easy Monicas Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can
totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But
Petes just doing this because he has a crush on me."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, And youre still not attracted to him at all?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I
cant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Yeah, but Mon thats totally different. He was youre health
teacher."
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh, please. "
0,season3,321pets,Monica, What? Honey.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh God, Im so sorry."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, I know. 
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ow!!
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Oh God!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!
Guess what?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so..."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Right.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as
stupid as you like."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (to Monica) You like it right?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! Im kidding!"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Yeah, come here!"
0,season3,321pets,Monica, What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Okay, good bye! (leaves)"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen."
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Umm, oh, about three months."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless
thing kicks in."
0,season3,321pets,Joey, (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Joey, I got you something! Open it! Open it!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Okay. (He opens it and its a baby chick) Its a chicken.
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Its cute, huh?"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They
require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lots and lots
of love."
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,
and talks to it like its a little baby.)"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Easy Lenny.
0,season3,321pets,Pete, So? I mean have you thought about it?
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Okay. Heres the thing.
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. Whats the thing?"
0,season3,321pets,Monica," I cant do it. Im sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you
have these feelings for me...."
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Wait, wait, wait, wait, thats-thats what youre worried
about? If thats the problem, weve got no problem."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Huh?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.
On my trip."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Oh?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Her names Ann, shes a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had
a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting."
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh, thats great! I mean Im-Im sorry, but Im so
happy for you. And now I can work for you!"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, I guess you can.
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him
on the cheek) All right, y'know what? Im just gonna roll right into that office
and-and quit!"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, All right.
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Yeah, sure. Good luck!"
0,season3,321pets,Monica," (rolling towards the office) Im quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls
through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) Im okay!! Im all right!!"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," (to Pete) Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
0,season3,321pets,Pete, What?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Why would you say that?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Cause youre still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Youre good. Youre good!
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial
gift."
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Thanks a lot.
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen."
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Hey.
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Hows she doing?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, She?
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," I dont know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I cant tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly."
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Excuse me?
0,season3,321pets,Joey, What?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!"
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this
morning trying to get her back to sleep?"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, You dont think I get up when you get up?
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Ohhh, here it comes."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in
and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I dont think so mister!"
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant..."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
0,season3,321pets,Joey," I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Ill take her back tomorrow.
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Do you think well get our three bucks back?
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?"
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Really? (Joey gives him a Like I would know look)
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Oh my God, is that still..."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Im fine, Im fine."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, No youre not.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Yes I am! 
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Rach!
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Look, Im fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. Its a very big deal, theres a lot of people there I have to meet."
0,season3,321pets,Ross," And Im sure youre gonna make a big impression. Hi! Im
Rachel Green. Its nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, itll still be broken
then."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Rach...
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Rachel...
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Look, either help me or go."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Fine. Ill go.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (He checks his watch) Sure. Ill help you.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesnt like how it tastes.)"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," (taking the brush back) Okay. Lets use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Okay. This stuff? 
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, All right.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Oh-ho!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Sorry.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Hey! Thats just poking me in the eye!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Sorry, Im sorry. Close, close, close..."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay, just sweep it."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Im sweeping...
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Right.
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay, now make it even, cause we dont..."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, What? What?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," We dont want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
0,season3,321pets,Ross," No. No, y'know you dont, you dont wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Since when, since when do you think I dont wear enough of this?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Well I, close your eyes, I just think youre gonna like this a little
better, cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Blow it.
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (blows it) Sorry. Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Sophisticated like a hooker?
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, Hey! 
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Hey, guess what Im doing tonight."
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, What?
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, I know.
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Ooh, I have to tell you something."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, What?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, But I cant tell you.
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me."
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell,
and I swore to like all my gods."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, No.
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Does it have to do with Joey?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, No.
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his
bed?"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," No, but lets come back to that later!"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Sure.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Yep?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Sure, Ill just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing."
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (checks his watch) Sure, okay."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, What?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, I dont want you to see me naked!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Rachel, Ive seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Yeah, but that was different. Yknow? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think its weird."
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, What?
0,season3,321pets,Ross, All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ross! Stop that!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Ah, Im sorry."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Come on! I dont want you thinking of me like that any more!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. Its one of my ah, rights as
the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Okay, okay, Im sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!
Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and Im the king. "
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Rosss...
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Come on, would you grow up? Its no big deal."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Yowzah!!!
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," O-kay!! See what you did, Im gonna be doing it by myself now.
Okay? "
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Aww, come on."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Thats it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! 
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Oh my God!
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Oh-ow!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, All right.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ow!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Look...
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ow!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ow!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Rach?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Ow! Ow!
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay, I do. "
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, I really do.
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in
a cab."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Okay? (goes into the living room)
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, whats wrong?"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like

0,season3,321pets,Monica, Does it involve travel?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, Noo!
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Does it involve clogs?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Clogs.

0,season3,321pets,Monica, Claws?!
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, No.
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, so it doesnt involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.
But, what about Pete?"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, (Shaking her head yes) No!
0,season3,321pets,Monica, What is it?! What about Pete?
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, I dont know! (frantically points at Monica)
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, I feel like Im talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would

0,season3,321pets,Phoebe, I cant!!
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," I, but youre so close! No!"
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, does it involve something to do with Petes computer company?"
0,season3,321pets,Phoebe," Oh, just go. Youre never gonna get it!"
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," I know. See, yes. Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely
different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways."
0,season3,321pets,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,321pets,Joey," (sees hes watching <i>Baywatch</i>) Ohhh. (sees he still has the
chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store
today."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her
to the shelter, and you know what I found out? "
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im
not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having
second thoughts too. "
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of
other animals!"
0,season3,321pets,Joey," Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Thanks, Im glad you see it that way."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
0,season3,321pets,Monica," I dont believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! Its
gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! Id be cold, but Im always cold.
Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners."
0,season3,321pets,Pete, So you like it?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)"
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Oh, youre welcome. (He takes a deep breath)"
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Did you just smell my hair?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Oh God.
0,season3,321pets,Pete, What?
0,season3,321pets,Monica, You still have feelings for me dont you?
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Now, nooo! Im just excited about the restaurant, thats all."
0,season3,321pets,Monica, Pete.
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?"
0,season3,321pets,Monica," No, its not bad. Its not bad at all. Its-its
really nice."
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And Im okay with that."
0,season3,321pets,Monica," You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one
who hurts you. Thats why I cant take this job."
0,season3,321pets,Pete, What?
0,season3,321pets,Monica," And well, we probably shouldnt see each other anymore. Im
sorry."
0,season3,321pets,Pete," Okay, yeah. I mean... If thats, if thats really what you want,
okay."
0,season3,321pets,Monica," Okay, bye. "
0,season3,321pets,Pete, Im sorry things didnt work out...
0,season3,321pets,Monica," All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She
kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Okay, youd tell me the truth. Right?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Rach, you cant look fat in an x-ray."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!"
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (to Chandler) Thats a duck.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Thats a bad duck!!! (to Ross) Howd the thing go tonight,
Ross?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Oh, it was, nah, well...."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, What thing? What thing?
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her
apartment) Easy."
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,
that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)"
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, What thing? What is this thing?
0,season3,321pets,Ross," I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for <i>The Discovery Channel</i>."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Oh my God! 
0,season3,321pets,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Ross, why didnt you tell me that?"
0,season3,321pets,Ross," Eh, cause I knew that if I told you, youd make me go, and I
knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, I cannot believe you.
0,season3,321pets,Ross, What?
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," That is the sweetest thing, I just...."
0,season3,321pets,Ross, (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, Okay.
0,season3,321pets,Ross," So, Ill umm..."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Oh, Im sorry I spoiled youre evening."
0,season3,321pets,Ross," No, thats, no, as long as youre okay. So Ill ah,
Ill see you tomorrow."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel," Um-hmm, yeah."
0,season3,321pets,Rachel, (After he closes the door) See ya.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
0,season3,321pets,Joey, What cha doing?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Having a swim.
0,season3,321pets,Joey, What about the chick?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, Chicks dont swim.
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Are you sure?
0,season3,321pets,Chandler, I dont know. Should we try it?
0,season3,321pets,Joey, Sure.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," See, I told you they dont swim. (He goes to take it out)"
0,season3,321pets,Joey, (stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.
0,season3,321pets,Chandler," Noo! (takes him out) Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby,
baby."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back
like two hours ago."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance,
hes at Flimbys."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Whats Flimbys?
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, thats the word I use when I cant remember the real
thing."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Okay. Hang up! Thats it! Come on!
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," No! Rachel, thats what they want me to do. My warranty expires
tomorrow, if I dont get through, theyre not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone
for free! We cannot let them win! Its us versus them!"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Ye-e-es!!

0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Whos number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers
play."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Uh, no, its-its just this person."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe, Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Yeah, kinda. Its this woman from work. I hope that wont be too
weird. Will it, Rach?"
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone
myself, so"
0,season3,322screm,Joey, But you said one.
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," I meant, me plus one!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?"

0,season3,322screm,All, Oh!
0,season3,322screm,Joey," (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes

0,season3,322screm,Monica," Joey, what are you doing?! Its never gonna happen, shes
seeing somebody."
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Yeah, and I dont have any cologne."
0,season3,322screm,Joey, The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
0,season3,322screm,Monica, (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe, Thanks!
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Uh-huh.
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Ooh, Im setting the phone down. (does so) But
Im still here! Just dont go anywhere Im still here. (starts to put on
the sweater) Dont-dont switch or anything, cause Im, Im
right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.)
Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on,
as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Phoebe?
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," What?! Monica, Im scared!!"
0,season3,322screm,Monica," All right. Honey, thats-thats a sleeve. Okay? "

0,season3,322screm,Hold Voice," Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us."
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Okay, wait, you gotta hang up cause were gonna be late."
0,season3,322screm,Hold Voice," Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe, Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a
chick to the theatre? "
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Of course not.
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe, No.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Hey, hey Rach!"
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Hi!
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of

0,season3,322screm,Ross," Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is
awkward."
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, Yeah?
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Well y'know cause Rachel and I used to go out.
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Oh, I didnt, I didnt know that."
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, I think were here.
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Oh! Yeah. 
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, Yeah.

0,season3,322screm,Man, Sure. (Hands him the ticket.)
0,season3,322screm,Ross," (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh"
0,season3,322screm,Man," Oh, well I thought that ah"
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didnt really work out too
well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?!
Look youre surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!"
0,season3,322screm,Man," Uh, the usher told us to come"
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go
through! Get out!! (They start to leave.) Here! (He throws him back his ticket.) (to Ross,
calmly) Hey man, you want the aisle?"
0,season3,322screm,Ross," No, Im good. (He sits down, stunned.)"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, (seeing Joey) There he is!
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Theres our star!
0,season3,322screm,Joey," So, so, whatd ya think?"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
0,season3,322screm,Joey, I-I wasnt in that.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, I know.
0,season3,322screm,Joey," (sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate."
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Hi!
0,season3,322screm,The Director," (stepping in) Excuse me. Excuse me. (to Kate) Sweetheart! (Kisses
her.) Come! (They leave.)"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, So thats the girl you like.
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Yeah.
0,season3,322screm,Ross," (drags Chandler over to buffet table) Im telling you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think hes
baaad news!"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy
Rachels dating? Well, thats odd."
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kates understudy,
Lauren."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, Hey.
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar."
0,season3,322screm,Lauren," Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right
after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day."
0,season3,322screm,Cailin, So. Howd you guys meet?
0,season3,322screm,Pete," Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months,
then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine."
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short
version."
0,season3,322screm,Estelle," Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! "
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle."
0,season3,322screm,Estelle," How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were
outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," No, they-they werent in the play."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Were not actors.
0,season3,322screm,Estelle," Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her
chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together."
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Could I borrow it?
0,season3,322screm,Cailin, (to Ross) Hi! Remember me?
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Hi! Yeah! Tommys in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in
front of him, I think hes gonna snap. (Hes watching very intently)"
0,season3,322screm,Cailin," Ross, Im gonna go."
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Go? Why?
0,season3,322screm,Cailin," I dont know. Could be because I dont feel like standing
around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream."
0,season3,322screm,Cailin, Good bye Ross.
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Uh, oh-ho bye."
0,season3,322screm,The Director," (entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people! (starts reading
the review) Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la Ah-ha! Joey
Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this
production."
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
0,season3,322screm,The Director," Kate Millers awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.
(Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by
Marshal Talmant is (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust)
Thank you, boys and girls, youve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces
with my Mothers crab cakes! (starts to leave) Excuse me!!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Anyone mind if I save this?
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Hey!
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Hey!
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Oh, is the play over?"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Yeah. Where were you?
0,season3,322screm,Hold Voice," Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller."
0,season3,322screm,Monica, You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe, Nah. I kept myself busy.
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff
in your room."
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Hey! Are you okay?
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Fabulous.
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Listen, drama critics theyre nothing but, but people who
couldnt make it as actors. You know what you should do?"
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Become a drama critic!
0,season3,322screm,The Director," (entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both
your houses! (walks away)"
0,season3,322screm,Kate," By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review."
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, classy. "
0,season3,322screm,Kate," Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a
soap for this!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too."
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Really. What?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. Well
stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post."
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Why the Post?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, you didnt see the Post?"
0,season3,322screm,Kate, No. You?
0,season3,322screm,Joey, No. Why?
0,season3,322screm,Kate, (drunk) So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, absolutely! Youre talented and youre good looking."
0,season3,322screm,Kate," Oh, youre sweet and cute."
0,season3,322screm,Joey, I know! Thats why they trashed me!
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute."
0,season3,322screm,Kate, What?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," I, I dont get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with
me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again."
0,season3,322screm,Kate, What? So you never went out with an actress before?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Kate, do you even like me?"
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Of course I do.
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?"
0,season3,322screm,Kate," I dont know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like
the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy Why cant I just pick someone
like you?"
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Thanks.
0,season3,322screm,Kate," You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, youre just
so, youre so, so (She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," (Checks to see if shes drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay,
hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, lets get your feet
up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) Im
gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl."
0,season3,322screm,Hold Voice, Please stay on the line. Youre call is very important to us.
0,season3,322screm,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, youve been up for 24 hours! Go
to sleep, honey. Th-this isnt healthy."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," No, no, Im fine, and yknow why? Cause of all the
riboflavin."
0,season3,322screm,Joey," (entering, happily) Hey!"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Hey! Didnt you have that outfit on last night?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Yeah! I stayed at Kates, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs,
where were ya?"
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Im so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see youre
play. I swear youre play is very important to us, thank you for your patience.
Youre play is the next play is the next play Im gonna see."
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Anyway, how did it go with Kate?"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much
we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we
stayed up all night talking, and now were like totally crazy about each other!"
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Joey, you had the night! "
0,season3,322screm,Joey, What?
0,season3,322screm,Monica," When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and
they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey, You-you think?
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Did you like learn about her family?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Two brothers, one died!"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Yes!!
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Yeah?!
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)"
0,season3,322screm,Gunther, (bringing Chandler a cup) This is from the woman at the bar.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
0,season3,322screm,Gunther, Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, What time is it?
0,season3,322screm,Monica, One.
0,season3,322screm,Ross, One.
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, 7
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Tommys supposed to be here soon, were going to lunch."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Look. Look, I wasnt going to say anything to you, but... All right,
I dont think you should be seeing Tommy anymore."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, You dont?!
0,season3,322screm,Ross," No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from
him."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," No, its not just cause Im jealous. (Both Monica and
Chandler give him a Come on look) I mean Im not, Im not, Im
not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at
this couple sitting in our seats."
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just
started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!"
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Okay, fine, fine. You dont want to believe me? No, thats fine.
(starts to leave)"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, Were kidding!
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Ross, dont. Ross!"
0,season3,322screm,Ross," You dont want to believe me, Im Mr. Funny to you. Mr.
Funny (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy) "
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, Whoa!!
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Whoa, sorry Tommy."
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Whats in the cup, Ross?"
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Umm
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, What is in the cup?!
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Okay, its coffee."
0,season3,322screm,Tommy, Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
0,season3,322screm,Ross, Its-its hot
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me,
huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo,
huh?! Huh?! "
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, (not seeing Ross) Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Yeah
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," (entering, finished with yelling at Ross, who follows him in shell
shocked) (happily) Hey!"
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?"
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass."
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Ohh, thats a good one."
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Sorry! Sorry, Im late; sorry, Im late! My duck and my chick
and a fight, it-it was ugly."
0,season3,322screm,Stage Manager," Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, lets go!
Lets go!"
0,season3,322screm,Lauren," (answering the door) Vic! Where have you been, baby?!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey, (surprised its Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Wheres Kate?
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, (whispering) She got a job in L.A.
0,season3,322screm,Joey, (stunned) What?!
0,season3,322screm,Lauren," Ive been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? (Joey
doesnt answer) Where have you been? Vic?!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Oh, ahh, go to the window. Im wanna run down to the truck and show
you something."
0,season3,322screm,Lauren," (at the window, shes looking down out of the window) What do you
got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp? "
0,season3,322screm,Joey," (grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering)
When is she leaving?"
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, (whispering) Tonight. What are you doing?
0,season3,322screm,Joey, (making like he is yelling up to the second floor) Im coming up!
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Hey, mind if I use the phone?"
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Oh, I (starts jabbering incoherently)"
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," Why dont you use ours across the hall, cause
shehasproblems."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into
Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you."
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Yeah, but you didnt."
0,season3,322screm,Ross," No, but its-its-its hot!"
0,season3,322screm,Rachel," Ross, would you just stop it! Its getting really old."
0,season3,322screm,Ross, I cant believe no one believes me!
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," I do, I believe you."
0,season3,322screm,Ross, You do Pheebs?
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was
next."
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," (noticing the chick) Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. (picks up the
chick) Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? (starts to pet him) Aww. (The chick poops on his
hand.) Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me,
Im so cute, Im a little chick whos disgusting! God, youre so
stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! (the duck wattles behind him and quacks) (to the
duck) Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!! "
0,season3,322screm,Chandler, Step away from the duck.
0,season3,322screm,Tommy," Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand!
(starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel) Well, I guess were not going out anymore.
Whaa!!!"
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Joey!
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Hey!
0,season3,322screm,Kate," Im soo glad I caught you, I couldnt find you before."
0,season3,322screm,Joey, Wh-wh-whats going on? Wh-whats this about L.A.?
0,season3,322screm,Kate, They still want me for <i>General Hospital</i>.
0,season3,322screm,Joey," But, but wh-what about us?"
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Last night was wonderful. But I-I cant stay here just for you.
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Well, so, stay for the museums! "
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Im sorry.
0,season3,322screm,Stage Manager," Joey, onstage!"
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, Ill go to
the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye."
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, (yelling from onstage) Where are you Vic?
0,season3,322screm,Kate, Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, Vic! Vic! Vic!!! 
0,season3,322screm,Joey, (to Lauren) In a minute!!
0,season3,322screm,Lauren, So this is it? Victor?
0,season3,322screm,Joey," Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he
can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I
gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. One thing
you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, youve got things you have to
do now, and so do I. And so Im gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts
pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the
side of it) and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I
return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all.
(gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because
Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her. "
0,season3,322screm,Lauren," So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)"
0,season3,322screm,Monica," Phoebe, its been two days."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing its one of those 801 numbers. Right?"
0,season3,322screm,Ross," Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah."
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," No, no, no, oh no-no-no, its has to be 800. (picks up the
instruction manual to check the phone number) Cause all those big companies have 800
numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one."
0,season3,322screm,Rachel, Phoe-be!!
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Sorry, Im so sorry, I will pay you back."
0,season3,322screm,Chandler," And yet, shes still not hanging up the phone."
0,season3,322screm,All, Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!"
0,season3,322screm,Monica, What?
0,season3,322screm,Phoebe," Well, I think I broke it. But thats all right, heres the
number you can call."
0,season3,322screm,Monica, (sarcastic) Oh.
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could
call it Chuck."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, Or... Dick.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler and Joey, Hey.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing
myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, Was it like a sneeze only better?
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey, (with a disgusted look) What was it?
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not
visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
(starts to take off his pants)"
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler and Joey, Whoa!!!
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, No!!
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his
thing.)"
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump
back.)"
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go
see a "
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're
doing and stops, the guys are stunned)"
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Ahhh.
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Yeah, right."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I
play my music. (points to the stage)"
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, Good deal.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, Hey!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Vince is a fireman.
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," 98 hot saves, highest in the force."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to
an even hundred. "
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," You're right, I know."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," (to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you
Saturday. (leaves)"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Okay. (watches him leave)
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that
Kindergarten teacher."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two
guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',
field-playin' juggler."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'
face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
0,season3,323towrt,Joey, Hey.
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,323towrt,Joey, (going over to him) Well?!
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally
benign."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey, Well what is it?!
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...
abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify
it, he was reluctant to remove it."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there
with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean
not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.
And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Pete's breaking up with me.
0,season3,323towrt,All, What?!
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from
Atlanta, we need to talk."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, And?
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something
bad."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Really?!
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty
cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught
on fire) Oh my God!"
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, Whoa!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, (stopping him) No! No! 
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," No, no?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.
(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out
of here!"
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, W-w-w-wait! Why?!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she
drags him away)"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill
third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes," Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.
(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes, Well that's not a third nipple.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, No?
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes," First of all, it's on your ass."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Well then, what is it?!"
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes," Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!
Will you come in here a moment?"
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Johnson, I'm with Hamilton!
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes," He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know
what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water
his plants. If y'know what I mean."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (entering with Rachel) and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,
always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, (disgusted) Uh.
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," So Pheebs, pick one of them."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Yeah. Which one do you like more?
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's
so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)"
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Well sensitive is important, pick him."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Oh sure, go with the sissy."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Jason is not a sissy!
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Y'know I have dinner plans!!
0,season3,323towrt,Dr. Rhodes," Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and
gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm
stumped. "
0,season3,323towrt,All," Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights
turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!
Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Yes, and the dimmer switch."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be
here, so please, do not touch anything."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler, (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," God, that is the nicest kitchen."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, I know.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a
great day."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey, Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get
out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically
answers it)"
0,season3,323towrt,Pete, Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, I guess that's how.
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Hey Monica, how's it going."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Oh its umm, good! It's umm, its good, just here watering the
plants."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete, Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever."
0,season3,323towrt,All, (standing up) Hey Pete.
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Hi, how ya doing?"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so
I know, is it good news or bad news."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I
have another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Oh no-no-no, it's still me."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah.
(listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm
gonna have to call you back."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Okay, I love you."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, I love you.
0,season3,323towrt,All," I love you, love you."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," So, what do you thing the good news is?"
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000
dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the
good news is?"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Oh my.
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!"
0,season3,323towrt,Pete's Mom, Hello.
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, And that's Pete's Mom. 
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could
be, Look how much money weve got! Y'know, I mean you could put, you
could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place
settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean itll be dry, but people
will like it."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean
we dont even know if hes gonna propose."
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your
first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date
kinda thing."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Well if-if thats what it is, then its-its crazy."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Monicas right. Were talking about getting married here. Okay?
She-she cant just rush into this."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons so
sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive its just better than
having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking
about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
0,season3,323towrt,All, Good luck!
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at
her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what itd be like to catch the money bouquet. "
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?"
0,season3,323towrt,Fireman, Oh sure. Vince?!
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire stations have)
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Wow! I didnt know you guys actually used those. 
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," So, whats up?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Umm, wow. This-this isnt gonna be easy. Umm, I dont think we
should see each other anymore."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, Uh-huh. G-good deal.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Im sorry.
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," No-no its okay. Its just that ah, I thought we had something
pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to,
and (starts choking up) That theres so much in me I have to share with you
yet."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Oh my God, I didnt"
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," (starting to cry) Im sorry, I cant talk. Im gonna go
write in my journal. (walks away)"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (to Ross) Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,
you should go to my herbal guy."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it
savory."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they
tell their friends about it."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalists card and leaves.)
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," (entering) Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt
resist."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Brides magazines?
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel," Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im
sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the
picture.)"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both
look at her.) Like for clubbing. "
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in
bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine
shut in amazement.) I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and
its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I
cant. Right? I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the
same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Oh my God. (starting to cry) 
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, You didnt break up with that fireman?
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out hes
incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal
drawings that he drew of me."
0,season3,323towrt,Rachel, Wow!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access
to a lot of charcoal."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so
Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now sos Vince (holds up one finger on
her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince
side) So Its really just about the math."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, (knocks on the door) Jason?
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," Yeah, come on in."
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything
wrong?"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Nah-ha!
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, You must be Ross.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," Listen, I got to tell you Ive-Ive never been to a guru before,
so..."
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, Ive attended some of
the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, lets take a look at this
skin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh,
huh. As I suspected, its a koondis!"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Whats a koondis?
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," I dont know, whats a koondis with you? (starts laughing as
if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! Ive
got a sav that oughta shrink that right up."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, I guess its worth a try.
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," Oh sure, we should see resultsWhoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
(quickly wipes it off)"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, What?! What?!
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, We appear to have angered it.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, We?! We angered it?!
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," Oh, I think I see the problem. And Im afraid were gonna
have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a What? look) Love."
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Oh God!
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross,
there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to"
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Ow!! 
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, Oops.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross," What was, what was that?"
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, Well its gone.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, What?! Hows that?
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj, It got caught on my watch.
0,season3,323towrt,Ross, Hey! (congratulates him)
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Lights. (The lights turn on, once again theyre too bright.) Uh,
romantic lights. (The lights dim.)"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Ooh, nice."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica," Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Well ah, Ive been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my
life"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Yeah?
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like
Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in
the world."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Wow.
0,season3,323towrt,Pete, Theres one thing missing.
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Whats that?
0,season3,323towrt,Pete, Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, Okay. (not sure of herself)
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, You wanna what?!
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most
intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, What are you talking about?
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and
Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed."
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
0,season3,323towrt,Pete," Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you
close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?"
0,season3,323towrt,Monica, My parents will be so happy.
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (singing) Crazy underwear, creepin up my butt. (Jason
enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear (In
her head) <i>Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep
playing. Youll get through this; youll be fine.</i> (She tries to continue the
song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as
gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me
after the show."
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, (going up to her) Hey. I was
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," I was passin by and I saw that you were playing tonight, its
kinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)"
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, (running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! Whats going on here? Who is this guy?
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," I dont know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!"
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, What?!
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, What?!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, Ive-Ive been dating both of you, and its
been really horrible. Cause y'know its been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I
like you both, and I, and I didnt know how to chose, so... Im sorry, Im
just, Im terrible, Im a terrible person. Im terrible."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," Phoebe, Phoebe relax, its okay. I mean we never said this was
exclusive."
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break."
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe, Really?!
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," Yeah. I mean y'know, we havent been going out that long.
Come on, we havent even slept together yet. Huh."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, You havent?
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, You have?
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)"
0,season3,323towrt,Jason, (to Phoebe) I-I cant believe this! You-youve slept with him?!
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
0,season3,323towrt,Jason," Y'know Phoebe, Im gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)"
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," (to Vince) Well, that couldve been really awkward."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince, You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
0,season3,323towrt,Phoebe," Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, Im gonna do that for you."
0,season3,323towrt,Vince," Uh yeah, I cant believe I ever went out with somebody who would
actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)"
0,season3,323towrt,Chandler," (comforting the duck) Everythings gonna be all right. Okay,
Dick?"
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," (entering) Hello, I am Guru Saj-(sees the duck)-Whoa!! (to Joey)
Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my
league."
0,season3,323towrt,Joey," Yeah, yeah. Hes got a, hes got a really bad cough, and our
vet, he cant do anything about it. Is there something you can do?"
0,season3,323towrt,Guru Saj," Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a
bat?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place called
Sample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign,
and it says Youre in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (entering) Hey.
0,season3,324ufc,All, Hey! 
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Howd it go with Pete?!
0,season3,324ufc,Joey, Tell us!
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Youre not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over..."
0,season3,324ufc,Billy Crystal," Im sorry. Ex-excuse us. Im sorry, its a little
crowded. Do you mind if we... (motions to the couch)"
0,season3,324ufc,Robin Williams," Yeah, could you scooch?"
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," Yeah, move over just a little bit. "
0,season3,324ufc,Robin, Keep on scooching.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm..."
0,season3,324ufc,Robin, Why? Why?! Whats wrong with me?!
0,season3,324ufc,Billy, Whats the matter?
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," I have a feelin... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist."
0,season3,324ufc,Billy, How do you know?
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," Well y'know, hes got access."
0,season3,324ufc,Billy, Yeah.
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," Y'know its that feeling you get, y'know?"
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," Like when you go bowling and you know youre in somebody elses
shoes?"
0,season3,324ufc,Robin, Thats the one.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," All right, so, so you went to Petes..."
0,season3,324ufc,Ross, What happened?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," Why is this happening to me?! I dont know, maybe its my
wound."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
0,season3,324ufc,Billy, So its-its not heeled yet?
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," No-no, its ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the
cream? Is there anyOh, theres the cream."
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and
nobody else."
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," What is it, Tim?"
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," Its me, Ive been sleeping with your wife."
0,season3,324ufc,Joey, (to Billy) So youre the gynaecologist?
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," (to Joey) Hey, Im trying to have a private conversation! Is that
okay?!"
0,season3,324ufc,Robin," (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you
please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would
you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy)
And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You
are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Billy," Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (pause) I have no idea.
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or
should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," No-no-no oh, keep your name, dont take his name."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, He didnt ask me to marry him.
0,season3,324ufc,All, Ohh.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, Well then definately dont take his name.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," He wanted to tell me hes gonna compete is some ultimate fighting
competition thingy."
0,season3,324ufc,The Guys, Pete?!
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Why?! What is it?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, (intrigued) Oh?!
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Yeah, but without the costumes."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, (disappointed) Oh.
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," And its not fake, its totally brutal."
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Whats fish hooking?
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Huh, whats fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Rosss
mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)
Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," So thanks for the warm welcome. Its good to have you guys on my
team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, lets go out there and get
em! Huh? And remember, there is no I in team."
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to my
office."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug, (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! Whats your name?
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah..."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to
leave) This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun. Good to have you
aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," (on phone) Thats right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank
you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Yes!!
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like
it was no big deal."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Yeesh, whatd you do about it?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who
has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," I gotta tell ya, I think its okay to be that guy."
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," Yeah, maybe its like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football
players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt) "
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would
never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob."
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head
in between em."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Okay, can we please go eat?"
0,season3,324ufc,Joey, Yeah. What are we getting?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (to Chandler) Anything but stew.
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," All right so, Chandler, from now on, dont give your boss a chance to
get you. Y'know just ah, dont turn your back to him."
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you
could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to
smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that
would smell bad?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I
set Ross up on a date?"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Oh, ah with who?"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,
and now that you two arent together, she asked if I could set it up, but if
youre not cool with it..."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. Shes yeah,
like, average height, medium build, bald..."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Oh! (laughs) Thats fine.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)"
0,season3,324ufc,Hoshi," You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I
call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we
concentrate on my training?"
0,season3,324ufc,Hoshi, Its just hard when I know I have e-mail I cant get! 
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (entering) Hi!
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.
0,season3,324ufc,Hoshi," All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this
ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I dont want
you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Oh, believe me, I dont want to get hurt either. Im being smart
about this. See these guys? Theyre the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here
used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be
a house painter."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Promise me youll be careful.
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, I promise.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, Yeah.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout
of our own..."
0,season3,324ufc,Hoshi, No! No boom-boom before big fight!
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, How bout just a boom?
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft
pretzel from one of the kids from <i>Fame</i>. Ready to go to the movies?"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
0,season3,324ufc,Bonnie, Hi!
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) Youre
Bonnie?"
0,season3,324ufc,Bonnie, I can show you an ID if you want?
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I
saw you."
0,season3,324ufc,Bonnie," Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Oh, that must be it."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
0,season3,324ufc,Bonnie, Thanks! You too.
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Yeah, she was bald, shes not now."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, How could you not tell me that she has hair?
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her
personality."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Why, does she have a bad personality?"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Oh no, Bonnies the best!"
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read
your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides
over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler
goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of
Chandlers co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, (to his co-workers) What is with him?
0,season3,324ufc,Phil," With him? Youre is favourite, youre his guy!"
0,season3,324ufc,Stevens, We never get smacked.
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once."
0,season3,324ufc,Phil," Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me."
0,season3,324ufc,Stevens," Im telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting
Dartmouth in the fall."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth
sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, No sir.
0,season3,324ufc,Doug, There you go. (smacks him on the butt)
0,season3,324ufc,Ross, (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," God Ross, what is that?"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Yeah, its the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,
plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Announcer," From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting
Championship debut! Hes known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and
Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," I love you, Pete!!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Announcer," And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! Hes a 300
pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! "
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guys pretty huge!
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Dont worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponents strength
and weight against him."
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
0,season3,324ufc,Ross, All right! You go get him! Lets go!
0,season3,324ufc,Referee," Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He
nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, Yes.)
Lets get it on!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, Uh-oh.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Hey! (she sits down next to him) Its me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell
you how proud I am of you."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck!"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now
you can just look back at this thing with no regrets."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," What, look back?"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Well, youre not gonna get going are you?"
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Well, no. But..."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Well Im not gonna stop until Im the Ultimate Fighting
Champion."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think
it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dads garage,
there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I
learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, You didnt know that already?
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Look, Im gonna get better. Okay? I promise you."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have
affected my concentration."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Yeah. That-that was the problem.
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, (joining them) Hey.
0,season3,324ufc,Ross, Hey! How long until Petes fight?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his
opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
0,season3,324ufc,Ross, Hot dog?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Four, please. (Ross looks at her) Im really nervous. (Ross gives
her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all,
I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really
terrific."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Ohh, thats too bad!"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," No, I-Im saying I liked her."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, (joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fights starting!"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Okay, well be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to
slap you again today?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be
okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as
planned, my butt will be smack free."
0,season3,324ufc,Joey, (sticking his head out the window) Fights over!
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Doug, (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," No, I ah, I didnt do them."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Oh, you forgot?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a
couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise,
verbal or otherwise."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi
Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) Thats okay, youre still my number one
guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, Doug!!
0,season3,324ufc,Doug, Hmm.
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express
yourself."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I
gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah,
the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug, Oh?
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its
just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all
the other guys jealous."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing!
Youre okay."
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler, Okay. (he starts to leave)
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out)
Ahhhhhhh!"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or
inside his shower drain?"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,
its Ross and that girl."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) Its a line
of ants! Theyre working as a team!"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Phoebe! (goes back to the window)
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is
breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Lets go."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.
Okay thats, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, thats
what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now
he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, You said it was okay!
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, You said she was bald!!
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! Okay, we
have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her
head! You owe me one bald girl!!"
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I dont get it.
Arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with Ross?"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, (quietly) Yes.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, Well isnt he your friend? Dont you want him to be happy?
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Yes.
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, So?
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," I just y'know, I didnt expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.
Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb) "
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe, (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, What?
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Oh, we killed them all."
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel, Oh! 
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution.
Ah, Im not supposed to move my spine."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Please tell me youre stopping now.
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Im fine! Id fight tonight, if theyd let me. (stands up
and starts swinging his arms) See this circle Im marking off here? This is my zone
of terror."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," I cant until Im the ultimate fighter. I will do it. Im
telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or
Superman. Now, Im not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at
this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! "
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right
forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica," Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt
yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it
without me."
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be
someone Im not. Ive got to do this."
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Then Ive gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
0,season3,324ufc,Pete, Mon-Monica?
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Yes?
0,season3,324ufc,Pete," Could you leave a note? Cause Im on a lot of pain killers now,
and I dont know if Ill remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)"
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so Im
happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Thank you, sir."
0,season3,324ufc,Stevens," (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by
accident."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on
the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? Youre not feeling left out or anything
are ya?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous."
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?"
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
0,season3,324ufc,Doug," Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)"
0,season3,324ufc,TV Announcer," Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes
just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
0,season3,324ufc,Chandler," Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
0,season3,324ufc,Rachel," Oh, I cant watch this. (turns her eyes away)"
0,season3,324ufc,Joey," Check it out, hes winning! (to Monica) Petes winning!"
0,season3,324ufc,Monica, Really?!
0,season3,324ufc,Joey, No-o-o!!
0,season3,324ufc,TV Announcer," Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his
favourite area."
0,season3,324ufc,All, Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)
0,season3,324ufc,Phoebe," Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
0,season3,324ufc,Ross," Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt
want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant."
0,season3,324ufc,All, Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on
that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else
but sex?"
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in."
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Well, I think we all learned something."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!
(She hands Chandler a picture) Thats my Moms writing! Look."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation
1965."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Y'know what that means?
0,season3,325toab,Joey, That youre actually 50?
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," No-no, thats not, thats not me Phoebe, thats
her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and
Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever."
0,season3,325toab,All, Oh!
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, That is so cool.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories
about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and
she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?"
0,season3,325toab,All," Yeah! Yeah, we can!"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," (to Ross) Shoot! I cant go, I have to work!"
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Thats too bad.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, So great! Okay! Tomorrow were gonna drive out to Montauk.
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Hey, Bonnie had sex there!"
0,season3,325toab,Monica," (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am
I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
0,season3,325toab,Monica, (sarcastic) Thanks!
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend."
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Yeah right.
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, Why is that so funny?
0,season3,325toab,Monica, You made a joke right? So I laughed.
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)"
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically
y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your
door, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Well Id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
0,season3,325toab,Joey, (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!"
0,season3,325toab,Joey," No, its just my luggage."
0,season3,325toab,"Chandler, Monica, and Joey", Hey!!
0,season3,325toab,Joey, Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who
knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house."
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Oh, I wasnt talking about his karma."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, (approaching) Hey! 
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, Hey!
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Hey-hey, check out the hat!"
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did
experiments on me! I cant have children!!"
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Seriously, where did you get the hat?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Ross gave it to me.
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Yeah, I think she looks good."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Ohh, thank you."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that
hats are back."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," And this time, theyve ganged up to form one giant, super hat."
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Go, go, go!"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Oy!!
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Whats with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the
floor, which is covered in sand)"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Well, yes, its kindve an unusual house. It has umm, three
beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (at the door) Knock, knock, knock."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in.
(on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Ahh, yes."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Hi Phoebe Abott, Im your best friends daughter!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr, Youre Erwins daughter?!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture)
Lily, from high school. Remember?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She
named me after you I guess."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! Theres Frank. (points to the picture.)"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah!
Im sorry Im getting all flingy."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or,
or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. "
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr, Oh.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been,
Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after
high school."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname
for the three of us."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Oh, what? What was it?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the
fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened,
that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," (happily) Yeah, no, it was great."
0,season3,325toab,Joey," (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"

0,season3,325toab,Monica," Oh well, where is he?!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," She was acting, she was pretending like she hasnt heard from him
on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isnt this
what he would look like now?"

0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
0,season3,325toab,The Guys, Yeah!
0,season3,325toab,Monica," Well, why would she lie to you?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," I dont know, but were having dinner tomorrow night, so I
figured, shes gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,
buy me presents, I dont know! So, youre all bored?"
0,season3,325toab,All, Ohh!!
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, Yes!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," All right, Im gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you,

points. Yeah."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off
one item of clothing. It hasnt happened yet, but were all very excited."
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of
electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at
him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take
Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me
five, and lets see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip

0,season3,325toab,All, Wooooo!!!!
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnolds, collect
three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joeys boxers!"
0,season3,325toab,Joey, Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Come on, take em off!!"
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Actually, y'know its kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on,
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," (getting up) All right, Im gonna make more margaritas! (She pours
the rest of the pitcher into Rosss glass.)"
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Im just making margaritas.
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Okay.
0,season3,325toab,Monica," I think Ill help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel,
and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, What?! 
0,season3,325toab,Monica, You painting his toenails?
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Oh, come on!"
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Chasing him all around the room?
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Monica, please?"
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Hes totally flirting with you too.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," (pause) He is, isnt he? I dont know, I dont know, I
mean maybe its just being here at the beach together or, I dont know. But
its like something... (shes interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, Hey!
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. "
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Oh.

0,season3,325toab,Joey, Were playing Strip Happy Days Game!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, Cool! Ill catch up! (She takes off her sweater.)
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?"
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Huh?
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
0,season3,325toab,Monica, You didnt even take off your pants.
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Yeah, well, lucky for you."
0,season3,325toab,Monica, What?
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, I dont know.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Shhh! Shhhh! Joeys asleep.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear
them last night?"
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea
turtles actually came up to the house."
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Good morning.

0,season3,325toab,Ross, (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Hey, what happened to you?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Oh, ah nothin. I just felt like hangin out here and reading."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came
off."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Ohhhh, sorry I missed that."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny. "
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Ohh-ha-ha!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much
easier when I used to shave my head."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were
bald."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, Really?!
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Ohh!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Really?!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, Yeah!
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, I mean you definitely should do that.
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Y'know what, I should do it."

0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, All right.
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Whats the matter, Pheebs?"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
0,season3,325toab,Joey, What?!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. Shes avoiding
me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she wont
tell me."
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. (she
starts to leave)"
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, Where ya going?
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my Father is."
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Well, are any of those people here?!"
0,season3,325toab,All," Oh, no!! No, no!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? Ill-Ill fill her
ice trays."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Hey, everybody!"
0,season3,325toab,All, Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Wh-haa-haa! Look what cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth
to keep from laughing.)"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, You wanna touch it?
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Nooo, but it, but its great."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Come on, touch it!"
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Hi.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Hi!
0,season3,325toab,Ross," I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she
happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who
was it? Oh, thats right, thats right, it was you!"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge."
0,season3,325toab,Ross, She said you gave her the razor!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, (joining them) Hey guys.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Hey!
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?"

thinking?!!"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, I dont know.
0,season3,325toab,Ross," You dont know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," All right! Ross, do you think its easy for me to see you with
somebody else?"
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?"
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
0,season3,325toab,Ross, You still love me?
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Noo.
0,season3,325toab,Ross, You still love me.
0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!"
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get

0,season3,325toab,Rachel," Noo! Maybe! I, I dont know. Ross, I still cant forgive you

0,season3,325toab,Rachel," I just, I feel, I-I just..."
0,season3,325toab,Ross, What?
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, I feel...
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," (to Joey) Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonna
playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! "
0,season3,325toab,Joey, But I made cards!!
0,season3,325toab,Rachel, Well! Good night. (to Ross) Im going upstairs.
0,season3,325toab,Joey and Chandler, Gnight.
0,season3,325toab,Joey, (to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the
window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any
noise!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr, Then don't break in!!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Im sorry.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr, What are you doing here?!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr, What?!
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe," Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay,
because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing
right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if
you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, youre just mean! (pause)
So, just tell me the truth!"
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. "
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, My Father is Chuck Magioni?
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last
year! And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats
the truth."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," But umm, youre right. I think that a person should know where
they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, (pause) ahh, (pause) okay. Im your mother."
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe, Heh?
0,season3,325toab,Phoebe Sr," Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all
floopy, and... "
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Im telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!"
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Thats not true! Her, she doesnt even know what she wants!
Rachels still mad about the whole thing."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need that
kindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......"
0,season3,325toab,Ross," I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!"
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, (coming back from her swim) Hey!
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," You guys, the waters great. You should really go in."
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&amp;M."
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie," Okay, well gnight."
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Good night.
0,season3,325toab,Bonnie, (kisses Ross) Dont be too long.
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Okey-dokey!
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, There is not one hair on that head.
0,season3,325toab,Ross," Hey, itll grow back, right? And she-shes really fun, and
shes cool, and-and Im finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel
was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and Im finally feeling
sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her,
and-and-and it doesnt work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that
again?"
0,season3,325toab,Joey," So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, youre
doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on."
0,season3,325toab,Ross, Yeah.
0,season3,325toab,Joey," Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnies free tonight?"
0,season3,325toab,Ross, (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
0,season3,325toab,Chandler, (in a fake voice) Hi there.
0,season3,325toab,Monica, Thats that weird voice again.
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date this
next guy, I swear!"
0,season3,325toab,Chandler," Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walks
away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!"
