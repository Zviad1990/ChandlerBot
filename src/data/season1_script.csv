0,season1,101pilot,Frannie," Hey, Monica! "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? "
0,season1,101pilot,Frannie," You had sex, didn't you? "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, How do you do that?
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, You know Paul? 
0,season1,101pilot,Frannie," Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? 
0,season1,101pilot,Frannie," Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no
snap in his turtle for two years. "
0,season1,101pilot,Joey, (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! 
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed'. "
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe," All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," I just thought he was nice, y'know? "
0,season1,101pilot,Joey," (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
"
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Guess what? 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross, You got a job? 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today. "
0,season1,101pilot,Chandler, And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off! "
0,season1,101pilot,Chandler," Oh, how well you know me... "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots! "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, How'd you pay for them? 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," Uh, credit card. "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, And who pays for that? 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Um... my... father. 
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, I know that. That's why I was getting married. 
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe," Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Thank you. 
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe," You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross, The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," <font color=""#0000FF"">All right, </font>you ready?"
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, I don't think so.
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... "
0,season1,101pilot,All," Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)"
0,season1,101pilot,All," Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.."
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," No. No, I gotta go home sometime. "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, You be okay? 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross, Yeah. 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? "
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.
Alright. Goodnight, everybody. "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Sorry- 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," No no no, go- "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," No, you have it, really, I don't want it- "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross, Split it? 
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Okay. 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, I knew. 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother. "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, I did. 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe? "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," Yeah, maybe... "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," Okay... okay, maybe I will... "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, Goodnight. 
0,season1,101pilot,Ross, Goodnight. 
0,season1,101pilot,Monica," See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? "
0,season1,101pilot,Ross," I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that
means.) "
0,season1,101pilot,Joey, I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe, (sings) <em>I can't believe what I'm hearing here... </em>
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, What? I-I said you had a- 
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe, (sings) <em>What I said you had... </em>
0,season1,101pilot,Monica, (to Phoebe) Would you stop? 
0,season1,101pilot,Phoebe," Oh, was I doing it again?"
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? 
0,season1,101pilot,Chandler," Did you make it, or are you just serving it? "
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel, I'm just serving it. 
0,season1,101pilot,All," Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. "
0,season1,101pilot,Chandler," Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. <font color=""#0000FF"">(Rachel
sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)</font>"
0,season1,101pilot,Rachel," Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give
this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank
you. (To the gang.) Sorry.Â  Okay, Las Vegas."
0,season1,102towsg,Joey," Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, Absolutely. 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we bought the ticket. "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Yeah, well, word of advice"
0,season1,102towsg,Joey, (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry? "
0,season1,102towsg,Marsha," Well, she has issues. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Does she. 
0,season1,102towsg,Marsha," He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits
at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close.' See? "
0,season1,102towsg,Marsha," Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
0,season1,102towsg,Marsha," Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross,Hi. 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, So. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," You look great. I, uh... I hate that. "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Sorry. You look good too. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,
uh... "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, A lesbian? 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Why- why are you here, Carol? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, I'm pregnant. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Pregnant?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe,...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
0,season1,102towsg,Joey," Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)
...now I wish I was dead. "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have. "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow. "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. "
0,season1,102towsg,Joey," Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, What? 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler, Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
0,season1,102towsg,All, Eeaagh! 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," Yeah, it's beautiful. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under
the couch cushions.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," No, look, don't touch that! "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler, You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with... "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler, ...Dinah? 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, You didn't. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh, I am sorry... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of
the glass pan.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler, Boys? We're going in. 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Carol's pregnant. 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe, (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe, She is so great! I miss her. 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, What does she mean by 'involved'? 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, So what are you gonna do? 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. "
0,season1,102towsg,Joey," .....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)
Mmm! What's that curry taste? "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, Curry. 
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller, Mmmm! 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," I- I think they're great! I, I really do. "
0,season1,102towsg,Mr. Geller," (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for
you, didn't she? "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller, They all had a thing for him. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Aw, Mom... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same
pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me. "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the
club, they were not playing very well. "
0,season1,102towsg,Mr. Geller," I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty
thousand dollars is a lot of money! "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller," Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, What's that supposed to mean? 
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller, Nothing! It's an expression. 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, No it's not. 
0,season1,102towsg,Mr. Geller," Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... "
0,season1,102towsg,Mr. Geller," ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank
God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. "
0,season1,102towsg,Mrs. Geller, (To Monica) And you knew about this?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Joey," Your folks are really that bad, huh? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you
could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, You're twins? 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler, What does she do? 
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe, She's a waitress. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to
leave.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica," Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. "
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents
actually preferred. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," The lights, please.."
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, ...How long was I in there? 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, I'm just cleaning up. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry
tomorrow? "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Oh.. a little.. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Mm-hmm.. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, A lot. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Mm. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Got me. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Remember when we were in high school together? 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Yeah. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-
and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Yes, yes! "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his
hand.) "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. "
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, Hi. 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," Ross, you remember Susan. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, How could I forget? 
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, Ross. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,
uh, we're just waiting for...? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Dr. Oberman. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, She. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," Yes, and she's very supportive. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.Â  "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Thanks. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.) 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Barry? 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry, C'mon in. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, (hesitates) Are you sure? 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. "
0,season1,102towsg,Robbie, Huh?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," So, how ya doin? "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Yeah, well.. "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back
in a sec. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, I dumped him. 
0,season1,102towsg,Robbie, Okay. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,
when, like, important decisions have to be made? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Give me a 'for instance'. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the
baby's name? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Marlon- 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Marlon?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, ...As in Mouse? 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, As in my grandmother. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about
Julia? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Julia.. 
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, We agreed on Minnie. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry, Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh, not much. I-I got a job. "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Oh, that's great. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Why are- why are you so tanned? 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. "
0,season1,102towsg,Robbie, Me?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry, No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs! "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry, Careful! They haven't quite taken yet. 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Okay.. 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted
to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, Wow. 
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't
happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. "
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel, What? 
0,season1,102towsg,Robbie, Me. (Spits.) 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to
you. And thank you for giving it to me. "
0,season1,102towsg,Barry," Well, thank you for giving it back. "
0,season1,102towsg,Robbie, Hello?! 
0,season1,102towsg,Susan," Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Thank you! 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," No, I mean it's not Geller. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? "
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, It's my baby too. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. "
0,season1,102towsg,Susan," Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," All right, you two, stop it! "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. "
0,season1,102towsg,Carol," Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I
think that borders on child abuse. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. "
0,season1,102towsg,Susan," Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say
all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is
too hard. I'm not, I can't do- "
0,season1,102towsg,Dr. Oberman, (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? 
0,season1,102towsg,All, Yeah. Yeah. A little. 
0,season1,102towsg,Dr. Oberman," Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for
sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be
involved in this particular thing right now. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Oh my God. 
0,season1,102towsg,Susan, Look at that. 
0,season1,102towsg,Carol, I know. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Well? Isn't that amazing? 
0,season1,102towsg,Joey, What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
0,season1,102towsg,Chandler," I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe," You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it
kinda looks like an old potato. "
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," Then don't do that, alright? "
0,season1,102towsg,Phoebe, Okay! 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, Wh- are you welling up? 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, No. 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross," You are, you're welling up. "
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, Am not! 
0,season1,102towsg,Ross, You're gonna be an aunt. 
0,season1,102towsg,Monica, (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! 
0,season1,102towsg,Rachel," (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry
today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I
really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up
getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline
and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel <strong>so</strong> much better now. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, (entering) Hi guys! 
0,season1,103thumb,All," Hey, Pheebs! Hi! "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!' "
0,season1,103thumb,All, Ohh. Ouch. 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked'. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, Since when? 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you'. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am'. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, And everybody knows this? 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Uh, Ross. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"" "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Hey, that was really good! "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Thanks! Let's keep going. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"" "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke."" "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," ""Smoke away."" "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, What? 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, Relax your hand! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, Not so much! 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Whoah! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, Hey! 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Hey! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Alright, now try taking a puff. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Y'miss it? 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..
God. (He continues to smoke.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, That's ridiculous! 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Can I use.. either thumb? 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced
tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! "
0,season1,103thumb,All," Yeah. Yeah, excellent. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, (leaving to serve others) Good for me! 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Y'okay, Phoebe? "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, What did they do to you? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Easy. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Oh, Satan's minions at work again... "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, What are you talking about? Keep it! 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine'... "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, We're with you. We got it. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this
giant karmic debt. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Chandler, what are you doing? "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? 
0,season1,103thumb,All," Oh! Oh, God! "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, What is this?! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, And this- is my reward! 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Okay, so this time I won't quit! "
0,season1,103thumb,All, Ohhh! Put it out! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in
Phoebe's coffee.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, So when do we get to meet the guy? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Let's see, today's Monday... Never. "
0,season1,103thumb,All," Oh, come on! Come on! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..
Sorry. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance
to figure that out. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Well, then can we meet him? "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Nope. Schhorry. 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd. "
0,season1,103thumb,Paula," Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll
tell you"
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked. "
0,season1,103thumb,Paula," Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy.. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Let it go, Ross. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Do you all promise? 
0,season1,103thumb,All, Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hey, Pheebs. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -<i>football phone</i> as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, What bank is this? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," (to all) Okay, please be good, <i>please</i>. Just remember how much you
all like me. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. "
0,season1,103thumb,Alan, Hi. 
0,season1,103thumb,All," Hi, Alan. "
0,season1,103thumb,Alan, I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, C'mon! 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. "
0,season1,103thumb,All, Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that <i>I'm</i> going out
with? "
0,season1,103thumb,All, Yeah! 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, ...What shoe? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Really! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," You know what I like most about him, though? "
0,season1,103thumb,All, What? 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, The way he makes me feel about myself. 
0,season1,103thumb,All, Yeah... 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Hi.. how was the game? 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Well.. 
0,season1,103thumb,All, WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Fantastic! I have one question
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Alan. 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-... "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball.. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
sometimes.. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, What? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," ..I dunno, a little too Alan? "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Hey, Lizzie. "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie," Hey, Weird Girl. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, I brought you alphabet soup. 
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, Did you pick out the vowels? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh,
I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, Saltines? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie," What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's
really money in here. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, I know. 
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie," Weird Girl, what are you doing? "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie," No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Oh, that's fine, no. "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, Would you like my tin-foil hat? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie," Please, let me do something. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, Okay. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, Okay. 
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," No, I'm fine. "
0,season1,103thumb,Lizzie, (leaves) See ya. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, Huh! 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, A <i>thumb</i>?! 
0,season1,103thumb,All, Eww! 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker! "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Does, um, anyone wanna see? "
0,season1,103thumb,All, Nooo! 
0,season1,103thumb,All," Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, It's worse than the thumb! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Hey, this is so unfair! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Oh, why is it unfair? "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this? "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Well, I-I could live without it. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair? "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""? "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
0,season1,103thumb,Paula, No. 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. "
0,season1,103thumb,Paula," Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got
through! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel <i>the thing</i>.
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. "
0,season1,103thumb,Paula," Honey.. you should always feel <i>the thing</i>. Listen, if that's how
you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
0,season1,103thumb,Paula," Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Do you have any respect for your body? 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you. "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's
not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, If only he were a woman. 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, Yeah. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was
wrong? "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, I think he's across the hall. 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hey, I might! "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb. "
0,season1,103thumb,All, You're kidding. Oh my God. 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the
universe?! "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going
on? "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," Uh, Joey.. "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey," Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (turns off the TV) Okay.. 
0,season1,103thumb,All, Oh! That was Lambchop! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Please, guys, we have to talk. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," Wait, wait, I'm getting a <i>deja vu</i>...no, I'm not. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Alright, we have to talk. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, There it is! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I
mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Is there somebody else? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, We didn't change.. 
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Look, I- I could go on pretending- "
0,season1,103thumb,Joey, Okay! 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you! "
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they
were. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, I'm sorry.. 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! "
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel," (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming
up- I wanted him to meet my family- "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
0,season1,103thumb,All," Oh, yeah! Right! "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Are you guys gonna be okay? 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (dubious) I understand. 
0,season1,103thumb,Alan, Wow. 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," I'm, I'm really sorry. "
0,season1,103thumb,Alan," Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. "
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, Relieved? 
0,season1,103thumb,Alan," Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
"
0,season1,103thumb,Rachel, Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, (entering) Hi. 
0,season1,103thumb,All, Mmm. 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross, So how'd it go? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica," Oh, y'know.. "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe, Did he mention us? 
0,season1,103thumb,Monica, He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) 
0,season1,103thumb,Ross," You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her
forehead.) "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler, ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
0,season1,103thumb,All, No no no! 
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've
gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! "
0,season1,103thumb,Phoebe," (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven
thousand dollars! "
0,season1,103thumb,Chandler," (returns) Yeah, alright."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.
You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care."
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Multiple orgasms!
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!"
0,season1,105egld,Joey," No plans, huh?"
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, Not a one.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, right, right, shut up."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. "
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. "
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. "
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Tony?
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," That guy, he burns me up."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He
called me <i>young lady</i>."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing
again?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh."
0,season1,105egld,Angela," Hi, Joey."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," My god, Angela."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, Are you gonna go over there?
0,season1,105egld,Joey," No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela. "
0,season1,105egld,Angela, (casually) Joey.
0,season1,105egld,Joey, You look good.
0,season1,105egld,Angela, That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
0,season1,105egld,Joey, You don't say.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Who?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat
problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Sure.
0,season1,105egld,Angela, Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
0,season1,105egld,Angela," Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob..."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too."
0,season1,105egld,Angela," Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey, What?
0,season1,105egld,Angela, We're just friends.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?"
0,season1,105egld,Angela, What four of us?
0,season1,105egld,Joey," You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's
smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and
call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," (looking out window) Oh, god help us."
0,season1,105egld,Joey, What?
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up
with her. Will you help me? Please?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross," (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross, It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're
going on a date."
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Nuh-uh.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, Yuh-huh.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwearÂyou want it to be dirty?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross, (sheepish) No.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my <em>Snuggles</em>? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, There you go.
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Yep.
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Which?
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Which what?
0,season1,105egld,Monica," You've never met Bob, have you?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey," No, but he's..."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
0,season1,105egld,Angela," Hey, Joey."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, Where are they? Where are they?
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some
puppies."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Eww, I don't wanna do that."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, Here we go.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Ok, have a good break-up."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Hey, Janice."
0,season1,105egld,Janice," Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful
day."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,
please?"
0,season1,105egld,Janice," We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the
little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,
and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,
I'm looking, I got you..."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, What?
0,season1,105egld,Janice, What?
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, (covering) What... did you get me there? 
0,season1,105egld,Janice, I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
0,season1,105egld,Janice," Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can
wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,
moose and squirrel. Whatever you want."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, That's great. 
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
0,season1,105egld,Janice," (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, That's it?
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Yeah, it was really hard."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Ok, you weren't there."
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Comin' through. Move, move."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Yeah, well, now you're kinda not."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I
don't see suds."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, What?
0,season1,105egld,Woman," No suds, no save. Ok?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross, What's goin' on?
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Was your basket on top?
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Yeah, but, there were no suds."
0,season1,105egld,Ross, So?
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Well, you know, no suds, no save."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's
machine."
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. "
0,season1,105egld,Ross," (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see
here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do
you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, What's that?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," <i>Uberveiss</i>. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? "
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Rach, have you never done this before?"
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these
are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross," (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow
up?"
0,season1,105egld,Angela, Brooklyn Heights.
0,season1,105egld,Bob, Cleveland.
0,season1,105egld,Monica," How, how did that happen?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Oh my god.
0,season1,105egld,Monica, What?
0,season1,105egld,Joey, I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," So, you and Angela, huh?"
0,season1,105egld,Bob, Yep. Pretty much.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute
nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
0,season1,105egld,Bob," Huh, I never really noticed."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
0,season1,105egld,Bob," Monica, Monica is great."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
0,season1,105egld,Angela," Yeah, isn't he?"
0,season1,105egld,Monica," It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an
emotional age beyond, like eight."
0,season1,105egld,Angela, You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
0,season1,105egld,Angela, Huh. That's nice.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it
really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out
anymore. Janice."
0,season1,105egld,Janice," All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins
to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can
do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had
to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm
sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, What uh-oh?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's
a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Ross, what's the matter?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Come on, show me."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your
whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, everything's pink."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please
don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big
marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my
own! I can't even do laundry!"
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to
inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just
thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could
we check it in the light, please? "
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Oh my god.
0,season1,105egld,Joey, What?
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Come on, they're close."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'sÂnot really true, is
it?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey," All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, (hits him lightly) Oh! 
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Ow!
0,season1,105egld,Monica, (leaving) I'm outta here.
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Really?
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,
we can break them up."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story."
0,season1,105egld,Joey," Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out
and hits Janice in the eye)... boom."
0,season1,105egld,Janice, Ow!
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
0,season1,105egld,Janice," Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the
worst break-up in the history of the world. "
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you
had?"
0,season1,105egld,Chandler," Oh, I don't know, a million?"
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, I'm fine.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, All right. 
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, I'm not fine. Here she comes.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, Wait here. Breathe.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, How do you do that?
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, It's like a gift.
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, We should always always break up together.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Oh, I'd like that."
0,season1,105egld,Ross, You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get
outta my way."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
0,season1,105egld,Woman," Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
0,season1,105egld,Woman, Let go!
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! "
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
0,season1,105egld,Ross," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
0,season1,105egld,Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Are you sure?
0,season1,105egld,Ross, No.
0,season1,105egld,Rachel," Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Yeah.
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Does it still hurt?
0,season1,105egld,Ross, Yeah.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm
gonna do this."
0,season1,105egld,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Hey, how'd it go?"
0,season1,105egld,Joey, Excellent.
0,season1,105egld,Monica," We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
0,season1,105egld,Ross," What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
0,season1,105egld,Monica," (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry."
0,season1,105egld,Rachel, Where's Chandler?
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe," Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
0,season1,105egld,Chandler, I'm free! I'm free!
0,season1,105egld,Phoebe, That oughta do it.
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's
picture! This is so exciting!"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's
not just <i>Freud</i>, it's <i>Freud!</i>"
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,
your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.) "
0,season1,106butt,Rachel, God. I feel violated.
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,
to have something else to do?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock."
0,season1,106butt,Ross, Is it? Feels like two.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," No, ten o'clock."
0,season1,106butt,Ross, What?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,
nine, ten o'clock!"
0,season1,106butt,Ross, Oh. Hel-lo!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,
fat, bald men!"
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.
Blarrglarrghh.'"
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh please, could she <strong>be </strong>more out of my league? Ross,
back me up here."
0,season1,106butt,Ross, He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Thank you, buddy."
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with
these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
0,season1,106butt,Monica, You could do that!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Y'think?
0,season1,106butt,All, Yeah!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very
aware of my tongue..."
0,season1,106butt,Ross, C'mon! C'mon!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, ...Yes?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," Yes, you said that."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,
what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) "
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Chandler?
0,season1,106butt,All, Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Whadja think?
0,season1,106butt,All, ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
0,season1,106butt,Joey," C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
0,season1,106butt,All, (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,
man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)"
0,season1,106butt,Rachel, What is it?
0,season1,106butt,Joey," The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!"
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe, Based on <i>this play</i>? ...Based on this play!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Hey, kids. "
0,season1,106butt,All, Hey.
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...
just a line."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army..."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or
less."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, 'We' would be me and Rick.
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Who's Rick?
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, My husband.
0,season1,106butt,All, Ooooohhh.
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, No.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," No, I'm still married."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay
with Ethan."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
0,season1,106butt,All, What?!
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, I suppose mainly sexual.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, ...Hm.
0,season1,106butt,Monica, Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you
listen to the story?"
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I
look at it is, I get all the good stuff"
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
0,season1,106butt,Ross," No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey, I couldn't do it.
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Good for you, Joey."
0,season1,106butt,Joey," When I'm with a woman, I need to <em>know</em> that I'm going out with
more people than she is."
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,
anthropologically speaking-"
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
0,season1,106butt,All, Yeah! C'mon!
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
0,season1,106butt,Rachel, Tah-daaah!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for."
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Well, whaddya think?"
0,season1,106butt,All, Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
0,season1,106butt,Monica, ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
0,season1,106butt,All, Uh-oh...
0,season1,106butt,Monica, How-how did that happen?
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe, (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," You guys, I am not that bad!"
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
0,season1,106butt,Monica, That is so unfair!
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!"
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away."
0,season1,106butt,Monica, Why not?
0,season1,106butt,Ross, Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
0,season1,106butt,Monica, I could do that.
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
0,season1,106butt,Monica, Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood..."
0,season1,106butt,Monica, STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
0,season1,106butt,Ross, Monica? You're Mom.
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
0,season1,106butt,Joey," (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He
hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has
just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
0,season1,106butt,All, Oh my God! Whoah!
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Well, what's the part?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!"""
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," Seriously, what-what's the part?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey," ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
0,season1,106butt,Ross," C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey, ...I'm his (mumbles)
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey," ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes
into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
0,season1,106butt,Monica, (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
0,season1,106butt,Joey," C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness."
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
0,season1,106butt,Ross," You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?"
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Alright, alright, alright... "
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
0,season1,106butt,Monica, For what?
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't
ever tell me what you did in there."
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
0,season1,106butt,Monica, He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs
back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!"
0,season1,106butt,Monica, I warned you...
0,season1,106butt,Rachel, Who is being loud?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He
starts to raid the fridge.)"
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
(He has armloads of stuff.)"
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. "
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
0,season1,106butt,Director, Lose the robe.
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Me?
0,season1,106butt,Director, That would work.
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is
lost."
0,season1,106butt,Director," Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll
it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action."
0,season1,106butt,Director," And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Well, I'm- I'm showering."
0,season1,106butt,Director," No, that was clenching."
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
0,season1,106butt,Director," I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,
rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey, I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," God, I love these fingers..."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Thank you.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She
starts to get up.)"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her
back down.)"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Okay.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Don't go.
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," Okay. Oh no, I have to."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, It's not Rick.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," No, it's-it's Andrew. "
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, He's... new.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," No, that's not exactly what I was.."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, So what do you want?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, You.
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, You have me!
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Nono, just you."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Whaddyou mean?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Lose the other guys.
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," ...Like, ...all of them?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and
laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I
thought that's what you wanted too."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'"
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish..."
0,season1,106butt,Aurora, Which one?
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, ...The second guy.
0,season1,106butt,Aurora," (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind."
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
0,season1,106butt,Ross, Look at it this way
0,season1,106butt,All, Hey!
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al
Pacino movie?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Nope.
0,season1,106butt,Ross," No? What happened, big guy?"
0,season1,106butt,Chandler," (to Ross) ""Big guy?"""
0,season1,106butt,Ross, It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
0,season1,106butt,Joey, I got fired.
0,season1,106butt,All, Oh!
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
0,season1,106butt,Joey, My mom will.
0,season1,106butt,Chandler, Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!"
0,season1,106butt,Monica, Maybe this wasn't your shot.
0,season1,106butt,Ross," Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
0,season1,106butt,Joey," Hard to tell, I was naked."
0,season1,106butt,Phoebe," No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
0,season1,106butt,Joey, Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
0,season1,106butt,Monica," I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. "
0,season1,106butt,All, Night.
0,season1,106butt,Rachel," Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
0,season1,106butt,Monica, (determined) Uh-huh!
0,season1,106butt,Rachel, Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
0,season1,106butt,Monica," Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her
room.)"
0,season1,106butt,Ross, She <strong>is </strong>a kook.
0,season1,106butt,Monica," (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) <em>If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,
and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! </em>(She buries her head
in her pillow.) "
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music
of Miss Phoebe Buffay."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you
suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights
go out) OK, thank you very much."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Oh, great. This is just..."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they
have no idea when it's coming back on."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Wow, you guys, this is big."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a
blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs
up)"
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my
grandma. (to Monica) What's my number? "
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Well, I never call me."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something...
something Goodacre.</i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in
an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! </i>(pause)<i> Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an
atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!</i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM
vestibule."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, <i>Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.</i>
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last
night. Yes, he was some guy. </i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, Hi everyone.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we
have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, That had to hurt!
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes
and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!</i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, <i>There you go!</i>
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, <i>You're definitely scaring here.</i>
0,season1,107towbo,Jill, (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.</i> Yeah, thanks.
(takes phone)"
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Hello?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Hey, it's me."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an
ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, What?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, I have no idea what you just said.
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, What's up man?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill
Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)"
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Alright, somebody."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
0,season1,107towbo,All, Whoooaa!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, That's my sister.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second
floor of the New York CIty public library."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Pheebs, what about you?"
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, Oh... Milwaukee.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Um... Ross?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
0,season1,107towbo,All, No way!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Oh, Rachel."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh come on, I already went."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, You did not go!
0,season1,107towbo,All, Come on.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the
foot of the bed. "
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Step back.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, We have a winner!
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course. "
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Come on.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of..."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
"
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Yeah right.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, (sigh) OK.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, You don't.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Really?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Mmmm.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, You do?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, I do.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)"
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, It's never gonna happen.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, (innocently) What?
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, You and Rachel.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend
zone. "
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)
What? What, now?"
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the
room behind them)"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Shhhh!
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, What are you shushing?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.
(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?"
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Ahhhh!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, See?
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)"
0,season1,107towbo,Jill, Would you like some gum?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Um, is it sugarless?"
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," (checks) Sorry, it's not."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Oh, then no thanks. <i>What the hell was that? Mental note"
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she
writes the lyrics down)"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," (to Joey) OK, here goes."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, Are you going to do it?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, I'm going to do it.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, Do you want any help?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," You come out there, you're a dead man."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Good luck, man."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Hey, where are you going?"
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Outside.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, You can't go out there.
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Why not?
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, Because of... the reason.
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, And that would be?
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," I, um, can't tell you."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," Joey, what's going on?"
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, About what?
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, He's planning your birthday party.
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Oh my God! I love him!
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, About what?
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, My surprise party!
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, What surprise party?
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Well, he didn't tell me."
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks
like I was second to last."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Hmmm... this is so nice.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, OK.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Yes, yes, that's right..."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Sorry, that was wax."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, (nonchalantly) Yeah?
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him
a stick of gum, and a strange look) <i>'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.</i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?"
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner."
0,season1,107towbo,Mr. Heckles," Er, yeah, it's mine."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you
sure?"
0,season1,107towbo,Mr. Heckles," Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, Wait a minute. What's his name?
0,season1,107towbo,Mr. Heckles, Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Bob Buttons?
0,season1,107towbo,Mr. Heckles," Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
0,season1,107towbo,Mr. Heckles, (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little
kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, (rolling) Lucky sixes....
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I
want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, (smitten) Hi!
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, And Joey....
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Hi!
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, And Ross.
0,season1,107towbo,Monica, Hi!
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, Look at that!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh... Italy, I think."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty
anywhere."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since
nobody told me... this is Paolo."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, (smiling) You betcha!
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," (chewing gum) <i>Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's
good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.</i>"
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and
put it in my mouth.</i> (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in
his mouth.)"
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," <i>Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...</i> (grimacing) <i>..chewing
someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're
choking.</i> "
0,season1,107towbo,Jill, Are you alright?
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum
flies from his mouth) That better?"
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
0,season1,107towbo,Jill, Perfection?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel, I have absolutely no idea.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, That's... that's classic.
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I
doing? This is so un-me!"
0,season1,107towbo,Monica," If you want, I'll do it."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I
won't."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more
exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at
her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
0,season1,107towbo,Rachel," Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing
in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Paolo. Hi.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...
we're kind of a thing."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," Thing, yes. Thing."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,
that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.
You know, and if you get in the.... um... "
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way,
of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Yeah! <i>Se vice</i>?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, So you do know a little English.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Do you know the word <i>crapweasel</i>?
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler, OK.
0,season1,107towbo,Jill, Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," No, you've got to whip it. "
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe," Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...
(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room
gets completely dark)"
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Thank you.
0,season1,107towbo,Phoebe, Thanks.
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Kinda... spooky without any lights.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey, (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
0,season1,107towbo,Ross," OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
0,season1,107towbo,Ross, Oh.. oh... oh.
0,season1,107towbo,Joey," Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have
to throw a party for Monica."
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," Well, this has been fun."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my
life."
0,season1,107towbo,Jill," Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the
cheek) See ya."
0,season1,107towbo,Chandler," Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got
any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get
better than this?"
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'..."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley, Do you want a date Saturday?
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, Yes please.
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, He's a he?
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna
go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye..."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be... "
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, You did?
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, I did.
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Yeah, I think so, yeah."
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, Not me.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
0,season1,108ndt,All, Yeah! Right!
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, WHAT IS IT?!
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
0,season1,108ndt,All, Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. "
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) <i>Bon giorno, caro mio.</i>
"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to
Rome."
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to
Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," So, uh, how's she doing?"
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," How-how are you, Mom?"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, What?
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, What's different?
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Nothing.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Oh, maybe that's it."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Oh God!
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller," Not just restaurants, from our house."
0,season1,108ndt,Nurse, Mrs. Geller?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, She looks so small. 
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, I know.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. "
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Bye, Nana. "
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Ross!
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, What is going on?!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite.."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, What?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, (reentering) What's going on?
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, She may have died.
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, She may have died?
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, We're looking into it.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"
0,season1,108ndt,Nurse, This almost never happens!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Now she's passed.
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," So, um, did she..."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Twice.
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, Twice?
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Oh, that sucks!"
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, You guys okay?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh..."
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe, Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Nono, she's gone."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, We checked. A lot.
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe, Thanks!
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel, Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
0,season1,108ndt,Joey," Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Here's my retainer!
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, I was just thinking. When my time comes-
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Dad!
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller," Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, You what?
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller," I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. "
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Define fun.
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller," C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller," Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, That's probably what they'll say.
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, I'd like that.
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Hey, gorgeous."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley, Oh! Okay! Phew! 
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," I dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," ...Quality, right, great."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great
couple."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley, What? He's cute!
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley, Is Brian...?
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
0,season1,108ndt,Shelley," Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get
a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, No.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian," You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong
one."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, Wait! We need shoes!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, That's really a day shoe.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian, Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work."
0,season1,108ndt,Aunt Lillian," No, it really should be burgundy."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Oh my God..
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Is everything all right, dear?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did
you know my ears are not my best feature?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Some days it's all I can think about. 
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe, What'd I say?
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel, (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Are these the shoes?
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel, Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't
it?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, It was a really beautiful service.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think
it might be time for you to start using night cream."
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, What?
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
0,season1,108ndt,Joey," Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, You're watching a football game at a funeral?
0,season1,108ndt,Joey," No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," You are a frightening, frightening man."
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel, Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,
there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he
falls into an open grave)"
0,season1,108ndt,All, God! Ross!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in
spasm...huh."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," What, what is it?"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe, You missed a belt loop. 
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Oh! No-n-
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Okay, it's in spasm."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Oh, no-"
0,season1,108ndt,Andrea," Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe," Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys
are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)"
0,season1,108ndt,Phoebe, Ooh! That's so nice...
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, ...Chandler! 
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, Hey.
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to
me."
0,season1,108ndt,Andrea, (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, No.
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel, You!
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, Whaddya got there?
0,season1,108ndt,Joey," (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability."
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, What's the score?
0,season1,108ndt,Joey, Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, That sounds like Nana.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, ...I can imagine.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, Tell her what?
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?"
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's
nicer when people just get along. "
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Huh.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," More wine, dear?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Oh, I think so."
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller," (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)
Those earrings look really lovely on you."
0,season1,108ndt,Monica, Thank you. They're yours.
0,season1,108ndt,Mrs. Geller, Actually they were Nana's.
0,season1,108ndt,Mr. Geller, Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Aww, look at the little thing."
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, Who are those people?
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Got me.
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. "
0,season1,108ndt,Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
0,season1,108ndt,Monica," Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
0,season1,108ndt,Joey," Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
0,season1,108ndt,Ross," (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Hey, Lowell."
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell," Hey, Chandler."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, So how's it going there in Financial Services?
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell, It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,
uh... I'm not."
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell, I know. That's what I told her.
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, Really.
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell, Yeah.
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, So- you can tell?
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell," Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell," Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend
Brian from Payroll, he is."
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler, He is?
0,season1,108ndt,Lowell," Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)"
0,season1,108ndt,Chandler," Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
0,season1,109uga,Terry, An advance?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
0,season1,109uga,Terry," Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,
really awful."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm
trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?
(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do
you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. "
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for
Thanksgiving?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross," No, they're not."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
0,season1,109uga,Ross, You're wrong.
0,season1,109uga,Monica, I am not wrong.
0,season1,109uga,Ross, You're wrong.
0,season1,109uga,Monica," No, I just talked to them."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Hey, hey."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, Hey.
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey
Tribbiani, man slash woman."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe, What were you modeling for?
0,season1,109uga,Joey, You know those posters for the city free clinic?
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy
guys""?"
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, Do you know which one you're gonna be?
0,season1,109uga,Joey," No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) "
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
0,season1,109uga,Joey, Thanks.
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's
Thanksgiving. "
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make
it just like Mom's."
0,season1,109uga,Ross, Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
0,season1,109uga,Monica," You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her
sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, Yeah.
0,season1,109uga,Monica," And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim
holidays."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Yes, every single one of them."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December
'cause he is lunar."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," So you're free Thursday, then."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, I thought it was $98.50.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Well, I'm off to Carol's."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
0,season1,109uga,Susan," No, she's at a faculty meeting."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan"
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to
the museum."
0,season1,109uga,Susan, What's it look like?
0,season1,109uga,Ross, Kinda like a big face without skin.
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about
bein' a lesbian."
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you
do it. "
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...
crazy?"
0,season1,109uga,Susan," What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross," You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Yeah, yeah, all the time."
0,season1,109uga,Ross, Really?
0,season1,109uga,Susan," But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too. Not that I believe any of this."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can
show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Rach, here's your mail."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," (insistently) No, here's your mail."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, We all chipped in.
0,season1,109uga,Joey, (to Monica) We did?
0,season1,109uga,Monica, (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Thank you. Thank you so much!
0,season1,109uga,Monica," (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," All right, I'm nine years old."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Oh, I hate this story."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Oh my god.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.
(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? "
0,season1,109uga,Joey, I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
0,season1,109uga,Joey," I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, What's wrong?
0,season1,109uga,Joey, Oh. What?
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Wait, wait, wait!"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, So I guess you all saw it.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Saw what?
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
0,season1,109uga,Joey, Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross, I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
0,season1,109uga,Monica," All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping."
0,season1,109uga,Ross, That's closer.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Oh, you must stop shooping."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Chandler, will you just come in already?"
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, That's not a question.
0,season1,109uga,Joey," But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. "
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Ah!
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Ok, Mom never hit."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," (stirring pot) Ok, all done."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Why would we do that?
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and
hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten
away."
0,season1,109uga,Joey, The balloon?
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all
over the news. Right before he reached <em>Macy's</em>, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," I can't, I gotta go."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often
does that happen?"
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe, Almost never.
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Got the keys? <i>or</i> Got the keys!
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Ok.
0,season1,109uga,Carol, Anytime you're ready.
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but..."
0,season1,109uga,Carol, Just aim for the bump.
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this
is too weird. I feel stupid."
0,season1,109uga,Carol," So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan
does it."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside. Why are we standing here?"
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
0,season1,109uga,Monica, No I don't.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
0,season1,109uga,Monica," No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, Do either of you have the keys?
0,season1,109uga,Monica, (panicked) The oven is on.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Well then get it, get it!"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, That tone will not make me go any faster.
0,season1,109uga,Monica, (angry) Joey!
0,season1,109uga,Joey, That one will. 
0,season1,109uga,Ross," And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
0,season1,109uga,Carol," Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
0,season1,109uga,Susan," Hi, how's it goin?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Shh! (singing) <em>Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey</em>! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
0,season1,109uga,Carol, I did.
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Does it always, uh--?"
0,season1,109uga,Carol," No, no that was the first."
0,season1,109uga,Susan, Keep singing! Keep singing!
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (singing) <em>Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo</em>."
0,season1,109uga,Susan, I felt it!
0,season1,109uga,Ross," (singin) <em>Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts</em>."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Nope, not that one."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Can you go any faster with that?
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a
gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, I swear you said you had the keys.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Why would I have the keys?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
0,season1,109uga,Monica, But I didn't.
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Well, you should have."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Why?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Because!
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Why?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, Because!
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I... I..."
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
0,season1,109uga,Ross," Here we come, walkin' down theÂthis doesn't smell like Mom's."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan
of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel," Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys."
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, You call that delicious? 
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe, Ooh. 
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, What?
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not
alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal."
0,season1,109uga,Joey, I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
0,season1,109uga,Monica," Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe, It's nice that he has someone.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler, Shall I carve?
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, By all means.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
0,season1,109uga,Ross, I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
0,season1,109uga,Monica, (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
0,season1,109uga,Joey," Oh, I will."
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
0,season1,109uga,Monica, Make a wish?
0,season1,109uga,Phoebe," Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd
you wish for?"
0,season1,109uga,Joey, The bigger half.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked."
0,season1,109uga,All, That's so sweet.
0,season1,109uga,Ross," And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
0,season1,109uga,Rachel, And a crappy New Year.
0,season1,109uga,Chandler," Here, here!"
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
0,season1,110monk,All, Oooh!
0,season1,110monk,Monica, W-wait. What is that?
0,season1,110monk,Ross, 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
0,season1,110monk,Monica," No, no, I don't."
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
0,season1,110monk,Ross, My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
0,season1,110monk,Monica," Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Why don't you just get a roommate?
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, Might wanna open with the snowman.
0,season1,110monk,All," Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy."
0,season1,110monk,Monica," So, how'd it go?"
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
0,season1,110monk,Ross, How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
0,season1,110monk,Joey," I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, So what are you gonna be?
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. "
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Yeah, you wish!"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
0,season1,110monk,All," Yeah, okay. Alright."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. "
0,season1,110monk,All, Woooo! Yeah!
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Phoebe, you're on."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, oh, good."
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, (Sung) 
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, (Sung) 
0,season1,110monk,Max," No. No, that's- that's okay."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"
0,season1,110monk,David, Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Could you speak up please?
0,season1,110monk,David," (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life. And then he said that- you said you thought"
0,season1,110monk,Max, Daryl Hannah.
0,season1,110monk,David," Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a "
0,season1,110monk,Max, Hard quality.
0,season1,110monk,David," -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling. (Sits down)"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?"
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Just a smidge.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, I think it's romantic.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... "
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, What?!
0,season1,110monk,Ross," C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! "
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
0,season1,110monk,Monica," Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Aah, y'killing me!"
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Do you always have to bring him here?
0,season1,110monk,Ross," I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces..."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
0,season1,110monk,David," ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Okay, alright, I have a question, then. "
0,season1,110monk,David, Yuh.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
0,season1,110monk,David," Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be
(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Sure.
0,season1,110monk,David," Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
0,season1,110monk,David, Rrrreally.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me. "
0,season1,110monk,David, ...Now? Now?
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh yeah, right now."
0,season1,110monk,David," Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop
computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks
up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. "
0,season1,110monk,David," Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the
desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
0,season1,110monk,Ross, So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
0,season1,110monk,Monica," I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Yeah.
0,season1,110monk,Joey, You know more than one Fun Bobby?
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, I happen to know a Fun Bob.
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..."
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Uh, four."
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Four.
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, Five.
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to
do?"
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball
drops?"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's
with who."
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, What's the matter?
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands... "
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Really.
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
0,season1,110monk,Ross," What, uh... what juggling thing?"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
0,season1,110monk,Ross, No.
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a
melon..."
0,season1,110monk,Max, Phoebe. Hi. 
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
0,season1,110monk,Max, No. Have you seen David?
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," No, no, he hasn't been around."
0,season1,110monk,Max," Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Minsk?
0,season1,110monk,Max, Minsk. It's in Russia.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, I know where Minsk is.
0,season1,110monk,Max," We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," So when, when do you leave?"
0,season1,110monk,Max, January first.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Hello?
0,season1,110monk,David, Hey!
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Hi.
0,season1,110monk,David, Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)
congratulations! This is so exciting!"
0,season1,110monk,Max, It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"
0,season1,110monk,Max," Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and
Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my
girlfriend!!' (Storms out)"
0,season1,110monk,David," Thank you, Max. Thank you."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, So-so you're really not going?
0,season1,110monk,David, I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Oh don't do that.
0,season1,110monk,David, Please.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Oh no no.
0,season1,110monk,David," No, but I'm asking-"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, but I can't do that-"
0,season1,110monk,David," No, but I can't-"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," It's your thing, and-"
0,season1,110monk,David, -make the decision-
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Okay, um, stay."
0,season1,110monk,David, Stay.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Stay.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
0,season1,110monk,David, It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)
0,season1,110monk,Janice," I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet
starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, You remember Janice.
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Vividly.
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,110monk,Sandy," Hi, I'm Sandy."
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger
girl)...You brought your kids."
0,season1,110monk,Sandy," Yeah. That's okay, right?"
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Par-tay! 
0,season1,110monk,Monica, That thing is not coming in here.
0,season1,110monk,Ross," 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?"
0,season1,110monk,Monica, I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened..."
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Alright. Just keep him away from me.
0,season1,110monk,Ross," Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
0,season1,110monk,Monica," Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, And then... your face is bloated?
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-
this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her
cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"
0,season1,110monk,Sandy," Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first
time I ever mentally undressed an elf."
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
0,season1,110monk,Sandy, Yeah.
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Hey, kids..."
0,season1,110monk,Ross," (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
0,season1,110monk,Janice," (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, (Imitating) But you found me!
0,season1,110monk,Janice," Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts
snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, Kill me. Kill me now. 
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
0,season1,110monk,Fun Bobby," Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two
hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!"
0,season1,110monk,Joey, (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
0,season1,110monk,Fun Bobby," It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see
him again."
0,season1,110monk,Janice," (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and
I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
0,season1,110monk,Janice," Oh, no. Oh, no."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, I'm sorry you misunderstood...
0,season1,110monk,Janice," Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these
times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)"
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Hi, Max!"
0,season1,110monk,Max, Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
0,season1,110monk,David, Wow.
0,season1,110monk,Max, It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Are you alright?
0,season1,110monk,David," Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. "
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, You're going to Minsk.
0,season1,110monk,David," No, I'm... not going to Minsk."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me."
0,season1,110monk,David," Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I
can't break up with you."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
0,season1,110monk,David," Uh, ow."
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me."
0,season1,110monk,David, I'll never forget you.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe," And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy."
0,season1,110monk,Dick Clark," (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a
virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
0,season1,110monk,Joey," There y'go, kids."
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.
(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)"
0,season1,110monk,Joey, You seen Sandy?
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's
bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to
tell you."
0,season1,110monk,Rachel," Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, The bll is drrbing!
0,season1,110monk,Dick Clark, (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
0,season1,110monk,Chandler, And the moment of joy is upon us.
0,season1,110monk,Joey, Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
0,season1,110monk,Monica, Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"
0,season1,110monk,Phoebe, I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, I can't kiss anyone.
0,season1,110monk,Monica, So I'm kissing everyone?
0,season1,110monk,Joey," Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
0,season1,110monk,Ross, Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
0,season1,110monk,Chandler," Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody
kiss me!"
0,season1,110monk,Joey, Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
0,season1,110monk,Ross," (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I
mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning
it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you
back."
0,season1,110monk,Rachel, ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Why?
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but
behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of
depression. "
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, We should do something. Whistle.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, We are not going to whistle.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Come on, do it."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, No!
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Do it!
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, No!
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Do it do it do it!
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I can't believe you did that!
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that
he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to
him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Maybe nobody's tried this.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even
sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's
artistic."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can
dance!"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,
y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, I wish all guys could be like him.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I know.
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, He doesn't have anyone.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"
0,season1,111mbing,Jay Leno," (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,
'Euphoria Unbound'"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Y'know, we don't have to watch this. <em>Weekend At Bernie's</em> is
on <em>Showtime</em>, <em>HBO</em>, and <em>Cinemax</em>."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," No way, forget it."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," C'mon, she's your mom!"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Exactly. <em>Weekend At Bernie's</em>! Dead guy getting hit in the
groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I
cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old
and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, You can say that because she's not your mom.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Oh, please..."
0,season1,111mbing,Paolo, Bona sera.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Last night.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a
dream I had- but, phew."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Hey hey hey! She's on!
0,season1,111mbing,Paolo, Ah! Nora Bing!
0,season1,111mbing,Jay Leno," (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London?
What is that all about?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Your mom was arrested?
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've
been intimate with a man..."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
0,season1,111mbing,All, Shhh.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
0,season1,111mbing,Jay Leno," (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how
is that going?"
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate-
but I get to see my son, who I love..."
0,season1,111mbing,All, Awww!
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
0,season1,111mbing,Jay Leno," (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a
mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad..."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first
condoms."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, ...And then he burst into flames.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the
mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams
played sports."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, What about Glen? He could be a Glen. 
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Nah... not-not special enough.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Waaay too special.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down)
Well, I think we're ready for some tequila."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, I know I am.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, Who's doing shots?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Yeah.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I'm in.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, There y'go. Ross?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of
time."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Anyone want me to appraise anything?
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.
No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a
writer."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just
start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia,
and bam! You have got yourself a book."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Yeah, any messages for room 226?"
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," You okay there, slugger?"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and
he tries to pretend he was in the other one)"
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, What is with you tonight?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker,
isn't it."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, No. It's the one he's licking.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, She's supposed to be with you.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, You're good.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my
books, and y'know why?"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages
for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you
eventually kill off."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, When?
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," No, it's you!"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Please.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy..."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Right.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," You are gonna be fine, believe me."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Uh-oh...
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Hey, is Chandler here?"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, Yeah.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes
his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a
kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, Right. No big deal.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Okay. 
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, What code?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'
aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, What are you guys doing out here?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning
racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to
bring me one."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside
and shuts the door)"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Ross, how could you let this happen?"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?
She's, she's sexy, she's..."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, You don't think my mom's sexy?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Well... not in the same way...
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,
alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, What're you guys doing out here?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Well, not playing raquetball!"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, He forgot to leave his grip size!
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, He didn't get the goggles!
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Well,sounds like you two have issues."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Goodbye, baby."
0,season1,111mbing,Paolo," Ciao, bela."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Do they wait for me to do this?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, So are you gonna tell him?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Why would I tell him?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Oh...
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, ...What did I ask?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Hi.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, What are you doing here?
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..
y'know, so what are you doing here?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my
way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!
...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to
reveal him wearing new pajamas.)"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Oh my God. 
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you
know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I
can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, What?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much
tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing
happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, (To Joey) You knew about this?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows
what woulda happened."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Thanks, man, big help."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," I wasn't- I mean, I-"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my
mom more than you. "
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, I know-
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Chandler-
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Me neither, y'know what-"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, What are you mad at me for?!
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Chandler-
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See
what happens when you break the code?"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Joey-
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. "
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,
do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Hello.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Hello. 
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, Going to the hospital tonight?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," No, you?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," No, you?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, You just asked me.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can
we do this now?"
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on
their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel, (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man
that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)
'Kay. (Sung"
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, What was that?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
(Goes to the counter)"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I
just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian
nightmare. "
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, That's very funny. We done now?
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell
her how you feel?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my
mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his
finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)
That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Alright, whadyou do with him?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, Oh! You're awake!
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy," Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, You look good!
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy, I feel good! ...Who are you?
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Oh, sorry."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I'm Phoebe Buffay.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Well, we both have."
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy," So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?"
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Well, actually it's just from me."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, I got you the foot massager.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, You know who shaved you? That was me.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, I read to you.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy," Well,... thanks."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Oh, my pleasure."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, You're welcome.
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy, So. I guess I'll see you around.
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," What, that's it? "
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," ""See you around?"""
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy," Well, what do you want me to say?"
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something
to me? ""I'll call you?"" "
0,season1,111mbing,Coma Guy," Alright, I'll call you."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe, I don't think you mean that.
0,season1,111mbing,Monica," This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-
we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See
you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
0,season1,111mbing,Phoebe," Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the
coma."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of
my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid."
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Really stupid.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,
honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Yeah. No. No...
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about
everything."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, You're kidding.
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a
mom?"""
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Wow!
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up
and realise I have a bomb?"""
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna
grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, That makes more sense.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," So, what's going on now?"
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to
the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Whaddya see?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey," Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking
away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing," You okay, kiddo?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Yeah, okay."
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, Alright. (Kisses him)
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Nice save.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
0,season1,111mbing,Mrs. Bing, Mr. Geller.
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Hey.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, You mean that?
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler," Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross, Yeah? How'd it go?
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Well, howdya feel?"
0,season1,111mbing,Chandler, Pretty good! I told her.
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your
mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go
down that road."
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
0,season1,111mbing,Monica, What's a 'niffle'?
0,season1,111mbing,Joey, You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
0,season1,111mbing,Ross," Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,
you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
0,season1,111mbing,Rachel," Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
0,season1,111mbing,All, Nooo! 
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," No-no-no-no, we're done."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no
compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually
eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me
to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt
Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?
(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like
voice) Hi Daddy! "
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, (waves) Hello!
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching
Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," So, did I hear Poconos?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Yeah, that's a big step."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, I know...
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes
flinging motions with hands) flung by now?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things
that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm totally, totally..."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call
immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,
and their little baby hands... "
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Need a new table.
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, You think?
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Hey hey, come on in!"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends
her love, along with this lasagna. "
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," So, I got the results of the amnio today."
0,season1,112towdl,Carol, Totally and completely healthy!
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a
picture frame)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
0,season1,112towdl,Carol, Don't you want to know about the sex?
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," The sex of the baby, Ross."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
0,season1,112towdl,Carol, Do you want to know?
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you
know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) Or isn't..."
0,season1,112towdl,Susan," Oh, hello Ross!"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Susan...
0,season1,112towdl,Susan," So, so, did you hear?"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
0,season1,112towdl,Susan," Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It
really is...do we know...?"
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
0,season1,112towdl,Susan," Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?"
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and
lightly taps Susan's shoulder)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? "
0,season1,112towdl,Carol," Well, thanks for the books."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,
then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"
0,season1,112towdl,Susan," All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
(intercom buzzer rings)"
0,season1,112towdl,Carol, Hello?
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, That's the rule.
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, How'd you get to that?
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little
breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, You knew about that?
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left
little to the imagination."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Yeah
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, You think we're ready for something like that?
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Why not?
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to
move out?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Why, are you moving out?"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, I'm not moving out. 
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, You'd tell me if you were moving out right
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Aw, I know all about Kip!"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and
got married, and things got pretty ugly."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Aw, don't do that"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,
to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica, And Monica knows...
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and
waves arms frantically in protest)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," WaitÂohÂheyÂhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Or an uncle... 
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Hi Pheebs!
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, Pheebs!
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Fine!
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Phoebe, what's the matter?"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh, right, that's me!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Phoebe, what is it?"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," All right, you know Paolo?"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Well, he made a move on me."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," More coffee over here, please!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)
And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica, Was it...?
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," ""Ooo,"" what?"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Uma Thurman.
0,season1,112towdl,Monica, Oh!
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, The actress!
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Thanks Rach.
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, So what are you gonna do?
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as
a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to
chime in)"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Feminist issue. That's where I went!
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, She is gonna hate me.
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a
table)"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, That's patio furniture!
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside
again?"" Of course!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat
something."""
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, You pick one.
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," All right, how about the ladybugs?"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine
dining!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey
turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Are you moving out?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and
shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um, "
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a
time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are
the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal
raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other
cookies"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Which proves that I never lie.
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, I guess you don't.
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Paolo made a pass at me.
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," So, what do you think?"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, I know!
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little
guys' heads?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at
Chandler) You suck!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Are you okay?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, I need some milk.
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)
Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," No...<strong>oh</strong>, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Such a pig!
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh, God, he's such a pig, "
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Oh he's like a...
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, He's like a big disgusting... 
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, ...like a...
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, ...pig...pig man!
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Yes, good! Ok..."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, The end.
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh, God..."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Should I not have told you?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better..."
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,
so..."
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Come on, two on one."
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," What, now?"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off
into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, (entering) How's it going?
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in
front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous
breasts!"" Here he comes! "
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Ooh!
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, ok bye-bye."
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a
lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)"
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe," Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed..."
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Oh, you're right."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Hey.
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, You all right?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Ooh, I've been better..."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than
him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh, Ross..."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, What?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Huh.
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great!"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, Oh...
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, You ok?
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
0,season1,112towdl,Phoebe, Yep!
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one."
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel, What?
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
0,season1,112towdl,Rachel," Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"
0,season1,112towdl,Girls," Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)"
0,season1,112towdl,Ross," I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, Wha-
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Wha-
0,season1,112towdl,Joey and Chandler, What is it?
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Hey!
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, Hey!
0,season1,112towdl,Ross, I'm having a son. Um...
0,season1,112towdl,Monica, <strong>Yes</strong>! And that would be a shut-down!
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
0,season1,112towdl,Joey," Uh, it's 2"
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler," Yeah, get out!"
0,season1,112towdl,Monica," You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use
my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I
gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone."
0,season1,112towdl,Chandler, (to Joey) One more game?
0,season1,112towdl,Joey, Oh yeah!
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," That is <strong>it</strong>! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, I'm sorry!
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Rachel, wait, wait."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Can I just say one thing?
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, What? What?!
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular
areas."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, Oh!!
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks
things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
0,season1,113tits,Roger, That's pretty much it.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, Oops!
0,season1,113tits,Roger," But you tell it really well, sweetie."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
0,season1,113tits,Roger, Okay. I'll miss you.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, Isn't he great?
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's
not too shrinky, y'know?"
0,season1,113tits,Monica," So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?
Vinyl."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)"
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Okay.
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Did I, uh, did I miss something?"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
0,season1,113tits,Ross, You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope
and a box of donuts."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice
boobies."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me."
0,season1,113tits,Roger," You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when
the laughter stops."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know,
that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Huh.
0,season1,113tits,Roger," I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child,
right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
0,season1,113tits,Roger, It's textbook.
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
0,season1,113tits,All," Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!"
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Hey, how long are you in the city?"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better
off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I
don't know this one."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, this is my friend Roger."
0,season1,113tits,Roger, Hi. 
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger."
0,season1,113tits,Roger," You too, sir."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays
his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something
funny!"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late
now"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.
Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. 
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the
navy yard and show you the big ships?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Since then?!
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory
in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been
in love?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, ...I d'know.
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
0,season1,113tits,Joey, You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is,
it's with two different women."
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this
double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be
cool.... This blows!"
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over
near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
0,season1,113tits,Ross," Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Hello?
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, (Intercom) It's Phoebe.
0,season1,113tits,Roger, (Intercom) And Rog.
0,season1,113tits,Monica, C'mon up.
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here."
0,season1,113tits,Joey, What's the matter with Rog?
0,season1,113tits,Ross, Yeah.
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
0,season1,113tits,Ross," What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad."
0,season1,113tits,Ross," Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
0,season1,113tits,Roger, I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
0,season1,113tits,Ross, Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
0,season1,113tits,Roger," I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for
overshadowing a sibling, maybe you..."
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage
your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
0,season1,113tits,Ross, That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, Isn't he good?
0,season1,113tits,Ross," Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
0,season1,113tits,Ross," Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. "
0,season1,113tits,Roger," That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta get going. "
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
0,season1,113tits,Monica, You're welcome.
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those
cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Night, you guys."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
0,season1,113tits,Joey, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your
pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta
laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a
pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, That's a good one!
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Hey, Joe."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Dad, Ronni's here."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, Huh?
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Hi.
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?"
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd
need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, Thank you. Uh...
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," So, who's up for a big game of <em>Kerplunk</em>?"
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss
the last train."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, I don't want you taking that thing.
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Who-ah-ho.
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, We'll go to a hotel.
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.
0,season1,113tits,Joey, No you won't.
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, No we won't.
0,season1,113tits,Joey," If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where
I can keep an eye on you."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, You're gonna keep an eye on us?
0,season1,113tits,Joey," That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're
under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your
girlfriend."
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Wow. He's strict.
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not
followed by ""No thanks, it's late."" "
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a
change. This has gone on long enough."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, What kinda change?
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani, I can't do that!
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Yeah, but this is"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Well, you're gonna."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of
girls..."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and
go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go
into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, No.
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that
wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes
along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
0,season1,113tits,Joey, You really think so?
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Yeah. I really do.
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)"
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Get off!
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Hi.
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Hi...May I help you?
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in
ours?"
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Okay...who are you?
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Oh, c'mon in."
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Thanks.
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Hi, I'm Rachel."
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Hi.
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, Bathroom's up there.
0,season1,113tits,Ronni, Great.
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the
shower?"
0,season1,113tits,Ronni," Oh, like, uh, five minutes?"
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey
and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. "
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Hey. Morning, dear."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
0,season1,113tits,Joey, (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, I thought it was Chandler!
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, (Comes out of his room) What? What?
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
0,season1,113tits,All," Hey, Pheebs."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, Hey. 
0,season1,113tits,Monica, How's it going?
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite
you guys."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, So what's going on?
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. "
0,season1,113tits,Ross," I dunno, there's just something about..."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Basically we just feel that he's...
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, We hate that guy.
0,season1,113tits,All, Yeah. Hate him.
0,season1,113tits,Ross," We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
0,season1,113tits,All," ...No, we hate him."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, We're sorry.
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Ma! What're you doing here?
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.
(Whacks him round the ear)"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Oww! Big ring!
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that
garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in
there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and
it folds away)"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Hold on, you-you knew?"
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James
Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my
accountant's,"" I mean, what is that? Please!"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,
always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not
those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he
has a hobby."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?"
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,
and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,
he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
0,season1,113tits,Joey, I'm...happy...for you?
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want
it the way it was."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani," I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you
see her?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
0,season1,113tits,Mrs. Tribbiani, That's sweet. Could I take her?
0,season1,113tits,Joey, With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
0,season1,113tits,Roger," What's wrong, sweetie?"
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Nothing, nothing."
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her
head in his lap)"
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a
liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
0,season1,113tits,Roger, Oh. They don't.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."
0,season1,113tits,Roger, What?
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, Intense and creepy. 
0,season1,113tits,Roger, Oh.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," You're not? See, that's why you're so great! "
0,season1,113tits,Roger," Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this
kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally
stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,
might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love
me, I need love!'."
0,season1,113tits,Monica," So you talked to your dad, huh."
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, Wow.
0,season1,113tits,Chandler, Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
0,season1,113tits,Ross," So Joey, you okay?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey," Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
0,season1,113tits,Rachel," Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
0,season1,113tits,Chandler," If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
0,season1,113tits,All," Hey, Pheebs."
0,season1,113tits,Monica, How's it going?
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
0,season1,113tits,All, Awww.
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Yeah, right."
0,season1,113tits,All, Aaawwwwww!!
0,season1,113tits,Rachel, What happened?
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,
and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
0,season1,113tits,Phoebe," Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop
0,season1,113tits,Monica, Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
0,season1,113tits,Joey, Sorry. Wrong boobies.
0,season1,113tits,Monica," Hello, Joey."
0,season1,113tits,Mr. Tribbiani," Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
0,season1,114towch,Ross, She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, Any contact?
0,season1,114towch,Ross, She lent me an egg once.
0,season1,114towch,Joey, You're in!
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Aw, right."
0,season1,114towch,Ross, Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel
thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂI don't think we need a third... "
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
0,season1,114towch,Ross, An egg?
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm
returning your egg."""
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, I think it's winning.
0,season1,114towch,Ross, I think it's insane.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
0,season1,114towch,Joey, Think it'll work?
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
0,season1,114towch,Monica, You can not do this.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Do what, do what?"
0,season1,114towch,Monica, Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
0,season1,114towch,Monica," But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I
know I do. "
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
0,season1,114towch,Joey," No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Pathetic mess? I know, butÂcome on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and
eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'
this."
0,season1,114towch,Ross, Hi. She said yes.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in
Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"
0,season1,114towch,Joey, (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,
no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
0,season1,114towch,Lorraine," Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, ...And what did you bring?
0,season1,114towch,Lorraine," She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my
hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, Janice?
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Oh.... my.... God.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," (angrily) Hey, it's Janice."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. "
0,season1,114towch,Joey," No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine. Just calm down. "
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and
yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
0,season1,114towch,Monica, Which one was Pete Carney?
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?"""
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. (imitating) ""I win! I win!"" I went out with
the guy for two monthsÂI didn't get to win once."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
0,season1,114towch,Monica, I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe, I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
0,season1,114towch,Monica," There's more beer, right?"
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect."
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, Or?
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
0,season1,114towch,Monica, Burning's good.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
0,season1,114towch,Lorraine," You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters
with my toes."
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
0,season1,114towch,Janice," By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,
I have a bag with just your heads."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, That's OK.
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little
puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty."
0,season1,114towch,Joey, (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," Uh, we might be leaving now."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
0,season1,114towch,Joey," She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm
not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Ok, you can not do this to me."
0,season1,114towch,Joey," You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
0,season1,114towch,Lorraine," (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,
Chandler."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, I hope she throws up on you.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, So...
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Just us.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, what a crappy night!"
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'
outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. "
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...
other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"
0,season1,114towch,Janice," So, do we have the best friends or what?"
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"
0,season1,114towch,Janice, I will go for that drink.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we
get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Each.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always
wanted to know..."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Happy Valentine's Day!
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Kiss me!
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Oh, Chandler, sorry."
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Hi, Monica."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Ok, well, this was very special."
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Rach, come see who's out here!"
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, Janice is gonna go away now.
0,season1,114towch,Monica, I'll be right back.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Oh, Joey, look who it is."
0,season1,114towch,Joey, (in disbelief) Whoa.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, good, Joey's home now."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to
Chandler) He just happened to call."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously) "
0,season1,114towch,Ross," I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole
um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los
Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
0,season1,114towch,Kristin, That's funny. Who are they?
0,season1,114towch,Ross," The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,
personal friend."
0,season1,114towch,Kristin, You mean they're lovers.
0,season1,114towch,Ross, If you wanna put a label on it.
0,season1,114towch,Kristin," Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Nope, nope, that's it. "
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol
and Susan) Helloo!"
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
0,season1,114towch,Monica," All I have is, is oregano and a <em>Fresca</em>."
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the
ritual in the first place."
0,season1,114towch,Monica, Can we just start throwing things in?
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer
shorts."
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
0,season1,114towch,Monica, No.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel and Phoebe, Eww!
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
0,season1,114towch,Monica," Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
0,season1,114towch,Joey, I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Hello, funny Valentine."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Hi, Just Janice."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and
I'm gonna!"
0,season1,114towch,Joey," (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."
0,season1,114towch,Ross," So, um, what do you do for a living?"
0,season1,114towch,Kristin," Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching
Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left
stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
0,season1,114towch,Carol, Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
0,season1,114towch,Susan," I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)"
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. "
0,season1,114towch,Kristin, (reluctantly) I guess.
0,season1,114towch,Ross, Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
0,season1,114towch,Carol," Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's
try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,
funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 1, What do we got there?
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 2, A piece of something
0,season1,114towch,Monica," You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 3," It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This
isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control."
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 1, You're our third call tonight.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel, Really?
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 2," Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, I brought you something.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and
Jan Forever."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, I had them made special.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell
you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things
are gonna work out."
0,season1,114towch,Janice, That's fine.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, (surprised) It is?
0,season1,114towch,Janice, Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh no, you see, actually it is."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," Oh, no I don't."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up
together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? "
0,season1,114towch,Chandler," I did, but..."
0,season1,114towch,Janice," You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a
foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know
it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
0,season1,114towch,Chandler, Call me!
0,season1,114towch,Carol, It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
0,season1,114towch,Ross," You did so. I swear, I swearÂ(noticing Kristin's absence) How long
has she been in the bathroom?"
0,season1,114towch,Carol," Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had
in 9 years. "
0,season1,114towch,Carol, That could be it.
0,season1,114towch,Ross," Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still
pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off
and eats it.)"
0,season1,114towch,Carol," Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay
through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
0,season1,114towch,Ross," No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life""
thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and
she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'
to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,
here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know
what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for
now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.
You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,
you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
0,season1,114towch,Carol," Oh, I love you too. But..."
0,season1,114towch,Ross," No but, no but."
0,season1,114towch,Carol," You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to
take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting
for you."
0,season1,114towch,Ross," That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
0,season1,114towch,Carol, All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
0,season1,114towch,Carol, Not her.
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 3," We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," So, um, will you bring the truck?"
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 3, I'll even let you ring the bell.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Oh, my god."
0,season1,114towch,Phoebe," See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
0,season1,114towch,Monica, They're nice guys.
0,season1,114towch,Rachel," Oh, they're firemen guys."
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 1, You guys tell them you were married?
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 2, No way!
0,season1,114towch,Fireman No. 3," Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell
them!"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon
stick.) I'm sorry!"
0,season1,115towsg,Woman, Chandler.
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you."
0,season1,115towsg,Mrs. Tedlock," Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the
end of the day."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do
with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from
the woman.) Nothing."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this
incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Hey!
0,season1,115towsg,All, Hey!
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, What's going on?
0,season1,115towsg,All, What is it?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al
calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
0,season1,115towsg,All, That's great!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, So.... I quit.
0,season1,115towsg,All, Why?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I
actually do."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, So was it a lot more money?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in
his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, ... the WENUS?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, So what're you going to do?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just
know I'm not going to figure it out working there."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...
Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.
You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a
job right now, so...."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's
an all-toast restaurant."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! "
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who
can, you know, create the entire menu."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, (excited) Oh my God!
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?"
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career
counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the ""a-gogo."""
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Career counselor?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, I don't!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.
You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Ooh! <em>Brian's Song</em>!
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, The meeting with the guy went great?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,
it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of
like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me
because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, What are you going to make?
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in
the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the
stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
(sits down)"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Who are you going out with?
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Oh, is this the bug lady?"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the
museum."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, So what are you guys going to do?
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her
back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, And he's not speaking metaphorically.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...
(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)
huh-huh."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one
look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Celia, don't worry!Â  Don't scream!Â  He's not going to hurt you!
Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, It's creamier.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Yeah, well, is that better?"
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm
keeping it down, y'know?"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, My God! What happened to you?
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,
personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""You
are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational
corporation."""
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be
doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing
something...something."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,
hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll
cheer you up."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split
this with you."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it
an <em>amouz-bouche.</em> "
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.
(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All
right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Ten dollars an hour for what?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, (hurt) Waitressing?
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, Uh-oh.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," But, but?"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?
And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I
can waitress in the Olympics."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in
'76. (dead silence) <em>Amouz-bouche</em>? (holds out tray)"
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, Talk to me.
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, No no no. Talk... dirty.
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?"
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, Yes...
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, Ah....
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, Say something..... hot.
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, (panicked) Er.... um..... 
0,season1,115towsg,Celia, What?
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, Um... uh.... vulva.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, (in disbelief) Vulva?
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it
wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind
of guy, you know?"
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you
want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll
tell you what. Just try something on me."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, (deadpan) Please be kidding.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like
to be doing right now."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, ....yeah... what else?
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this
conversation. (gets up, walks across room)"
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Joey, please."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....
you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, (impressed) Wow.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Alright, now you say something."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, I... ahem... I really don't think so.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Come on! You like this woman, right?"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, Yeah.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," You want to see her again, right?"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, Sure.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at
me when I'm doing this."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my
lips."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," I, er..."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, I want to take my tongue... and... 
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, ....and....
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, Say it... say it!
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, (smiling)....with??
0,season1,115towsg,Ross, (rushing to explain) Funny story!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get
together."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called
again."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Again?
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands
phone to Chandler) And again."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?
(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,
this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I
can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you
mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is
not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm
telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on
Monday! (slams the phone down)"
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Well?
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this
is a cube."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Oh! You have a window!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler, Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Oh look! That guy's peeing!
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this
out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, (sitting) OK.
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you
come in here for a moment? "
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," Last time I do that, I promise."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Who was that?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Ten dollars an hour.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, No.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Twelve dollars an hour.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,
desperate) twenty dollars an hour."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Done.
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Hi Steve!
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, (to Steve) This is Rachel.
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," (unconcerned) Yeah, OK."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I
can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)
of, OK, smells."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, It's a lovely apartment.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," I was just being polite, but, alright. "
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, What's up?
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, What?
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," Let me, let me get you some wine!"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica
brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...
(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he
finishes)... ginger."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!"
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, I'm so glad you liked them!
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a
half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up
and goes into the kitchen)"
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. "
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, ""You
see!"") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want
to spoil your appetite."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," No, we don't. (reaches for box) "
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down
to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.) "
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries
to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, (childishly) No.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, Give them to me.
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Alright, we'll share."
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," No, give me the..."
0,season1,115towsg,Steve," Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks
open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!
I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on
a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) ""Help!Â  I'm drowning! Â 
Help!"""
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, What?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica, What?
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, Why?
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like
this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, (excited) Hey!
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, What a tool!
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel, You don't want to work for a guy like that.
0,season1,115towsg,Monica," I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Oh, I was unbelievable."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," All right, Ross!"
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...
at one point there were villagers."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,
it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
0,season1,115towsg,Joey, You cuddled.
0,season1,115towsg,Ross," Yeah, which was nice."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
0,season1,115towsg,Rachel," Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
0,season1,115towsg,Joey," Yeah, where the hell is he?"
0,season1,115towsg,Chandler," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you
something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams
phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, How's this? (presses down hard)
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, Eeeee!
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe, Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, Aaaaah!
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down
elsewhere)"
0,season1,115towsg,Steve, No.
0,season1,115towsg,Phoebe," What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in
pain)"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she
fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, Fill this out and bring it back to me.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, You.
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Really?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and
kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Why, how much is this gonna cost?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Well there's not much we can do.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Hah, no no no no no no no no no no."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as
my ""In case of emergency"" person?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her
voice anyway) That's insurance fraud."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go
home. Ow ow ow ow!"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny
laugh) these forms (tiny laugh)."
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, Why?
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling
out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine."
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, You are an idiot. (She hands over a blank form).
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny
laugh)."
0,season1,117part2,Ross, I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
0,season1,117part2,Chandler and Joey, That's nice.
0,season1,117part2,Ross," No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm
on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do
something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
0,season1,117part2,Joey, Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us.
And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, What are you crazy? That's a baby!
0,season1,117part2,Joey, He should take the sack?
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in
time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so
not ready to be a father."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most
responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real
expensive?"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Well, only if you order stuff."
0,season1,117part2,Joey, I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
0,season1,117part2,Joey, When's that?
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Tonight.
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross, You take your time.
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, There it is! So what're you gonna do?
0,season1,117part2,Joey," What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with
Ursula."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, And your friend Phoebe?
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't
you guys?"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be
starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," Okay, errrr, Monica?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel (as Monica)," Hi, this is my friend Rachel."
0,season1,117part2,Monica (as Rachel), Hi.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," (Smiling) Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen," (Smiling even more and attempting to take over) And I'm his friend,
Dr.Rosen."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen, Excuse me?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young,
young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
0,season1,117part2,Monica (as Rachel), Thank you.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel (as Monica), Right.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Uh, you left out the stupid part."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow
night, and I said ""yes."""
0,season1,117part2,Monica," I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's
like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the
air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Alright, what have we learned so far?"
0,season1,117part2,The Whole Party, (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!!
0,season1,117part2,Ross, What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Was that the cake?
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Come on, she'll be here any minute."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, I hope it's okay.
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Oh...
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," (Reading) ""Happy Birthday Peehe."""
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses."
0,season1,117part2,Ross," (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Hey, what's going on?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Oh, we just..."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe's Friends, (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all
scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging
people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, Did you see Betty?
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh,
ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a
thing?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know,
um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," No, we can go to Williamsburg."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Rachel, the cute doctors are here."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (entering from her room) Okay, coming!"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Hi, come on in."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, Hey.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Hi, Geoffrey."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Hi.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen," Ah here, we brought wine."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine,
so how could we resist?"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Oh, that's great. Look at that."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen," So, Monica, how's the ankle?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica, It's uh...
0,season1,117part2,Monica (as Rachel)," ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is
your ankle."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel (as Monica)," You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um...
Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...
(They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really
are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?"
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, So?
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen, So... they sss-still seem normal.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, That's because they are.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen," (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out...
Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into..."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in
the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this.
(Dr. Rosen obeys.)"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a
big baby."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to
god, just because you get so uptight every time we..."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Sure, every time, you're such a princess..."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, You know what?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, What?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, You know what?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, What!?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, You know what?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (getting angry) What!!?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Hello! Here we go!
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen, This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in
a few months ago."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get
married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, Really?
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey,
that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?"
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen," So, Monica, what do you do?"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen, Good for you.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do."
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Rosen, This hummus is great.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, God bless the chickpea.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I
was a cow?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both
do that!"
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell," (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh,

0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away
from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um...
there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Would you excuse me for a second?
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel
can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy
Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping
the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing ""You are..."")
...dead!"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Ross, he's got the remote again."
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Maybe not.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes
the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just
check and see if see if she's here."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a
problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god..."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel and Monica," Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out
what they want!"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at
Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank
you. (Hangs up)"
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, What?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This
was just not worth it."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Thank you.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Okay, let me just change."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Yes.
0,season1,117part2,Joey, (entering quietly) Hey.
0,season1,117part2,Ross and Chandler, Hey!
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, Trouble?
0,season1,117part2,Joey, Your sister stood me up the other night.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for
you?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Well did you try calling her?
0,season1,117part2,Joey," I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she
was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, Oh!
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Um you, you got a minute?"
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Um, yeah, I'm just... (waving dismissively at the concept) ..working."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, So.
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, Uh-huh.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Oh, wow! You remembered! (Opening it) Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!"
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Right, like the kind you..."
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Right... Oh, I got something for you, too."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, How'd you know I was coming?
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Um, yeah, um, twin thing."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, I can't believe you did this.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?"
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, Does he know?
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, Who?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, He is? Why?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, You got me.
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, Right.
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," So, um, are you gonna call him?"
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," No, Joey."
0,season1,117part2,Ursula," Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her
food) Do you want some chicken?"
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, No. No food with a face.
0,season1,117part2,Ursula, You have not changed!
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," Yeah, you too."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Hi, remember us?"
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.
0,season1,117part2,Monica," (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a
signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one
(little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause
um..."
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, You're that stupid.
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check."
0,season1,117part2,Nurse," Well, you know your insurance will cover that."
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not
that bright either."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Uh-huh.
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his
relationships are affected by this."
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Do you have a point?
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," You know, you think I would."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, What's up with the simian?
0,season1,117part2,Ross, It's just a fur ball.
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
0,season1,117part2,Ross, I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
0,season1,117part2,Ross, You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, (angrily) You go get that animal outta here.
0,season1,117part2,Ross," No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's
choking I don't know what else to do."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, What's goin' on?
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, Marcel swallowed a <em>Scrabble</em> tile.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, Oh.
0,season1,117part2,Nurse, Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches <em>Jeopardy!</em>
He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!"
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, I'll take a look at him.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel and Monica," Oh, thank you."
0,season1,117part2,Monica, Michael.
0,season1,117part2,Dr. Mitchell, Rachel.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, What?
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (as Rachel) Monica.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, (as Monica) Oh.
0,season1,117part2,Monica, (as Rachel) Hi.
0,season1,117part2,Rachel, (as Monica) Hi.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, (as Ursula) Hey.
0,season1,117part2,Joey, Urse...
0,season1,117part2,Joey," ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Listen, um..."
0,season1,117part2,Joey," No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen.""
I've said that ""listen."""
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, (as Ursula) I'm sorry.
0,season1,117part2,Joey," I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the
bridge?"
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, (as Ursula)
0,season1,117part2,Joey, You don't drink.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)"
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
0,season1,117part2,Joey, Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
0,season1,117part2,Joey," (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's
either her or me."
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe," (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee)
You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
0,season1,117part2,Joey, I know...
0,season1,117part2,Joey," I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but
you have never looked so beautiful."
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, Really?
0,season1,117part2,Joey, Pheebs?
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
0,season1,117part2,Ross, He looks so tiny.
0,season1,117part2,Joey, We just got the message.
0,season1,117part2,Phoebe, Is he alright?
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," No, why?"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler," Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is
very dad."
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Oh, look, he's waking up!"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?"
0,season1,117part2,Ross, Aqui estÃ¡. (Here it is!)
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Â¿A quiÃ©n pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's
chicken?)"
0,season1,117part2,Chandler, Â¡Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
0,season1,117part2,Rachel," Â¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo estÃ¡ haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look,
Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)"
0,season1,117part2,All,Â¡Ewww! (Ewww!)
0,season1,117part2,All," Â¡Hola, Joey! (Hi, Joey!)"
0,season1,117part2,Joey," Â¡Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)"
0,season1,117part2,Monica," Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got
the remote.)"
0,season1,117part2,Ross," Â¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t
like the program!)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
0,season1,118poke,Monica, Do you really want a job with <i>Popular Mechanics</i>?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work
for."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a
waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse
me...'"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Rach, did you proofread these?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Uh... yeah, why?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper
skills."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Hey, guys."
0,season1,118poke,Chandler and Ross, Hey.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly)"
0,season1,118poke,Monica, Lots of responses.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (to Monica)
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, (reading)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (out loud)
0,season1,118poke,Monica, (reading)
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Wow!
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, What?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, (reading)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (grabs the bill) Give me that!
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out
with her again?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I don't know.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really
happened' thing?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," No, it's not just that. It's justÂI want someone who... who does
something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins
to stare lovingly at Rachel)"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, ...little playthings with yarn?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, What?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, Could you want her more?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Who?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from <i>Whats Happening</i>."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over,
Ross lays head on table)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Hi! How are you?
0,season1,118poke,Ross," We're fine, we're fine."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, OK. (walks away) 
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Shut up!
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, We're notÂwe're not saying anything.
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, What?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Thank you.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright..."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, And then he did.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of
sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," No, women are welcome to play."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some
kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
0,season1,118poke,Girls," Oh, yeah, right."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Really.
0,season1,118poke,Monica," I mean, that's a typical guy response."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
0,season1,118poke,Girls, No.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, But you could teach us.
0,season1,118poke,Guys, No.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh, good for you!"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Congratulations!
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tÂyou can't do..."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for
fours."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Oh, you're... (gives up)"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe and Rachel, OOooooo!
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You
can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or
pretz...(look of realization)"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer..."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High
stakes... big bucks..."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they
didn't look happy..."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two
cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the
cards."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, (to Joey)
0,season1,118poke,Joey, About what?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, About how good your cards were.
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Heh... I was bluffing.
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before
work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)"
0,season1,118poke,Guys," Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Settle what?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us
the land, so..."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Oh. Right.
0,season1,118poke,Joey," You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget
about the money, alright?"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Hell no, we'll pay!"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
0,season1,118poke,Monica, And you know what? We want a rematch.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (to Ross)
0,season1,118poke,Ross, (pause)...Yeah.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Yes, and I get my ya-yas from <i>Ikea</i>. You have to put them
together yourself, but they cost a little less."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to
win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to
be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)"
0,season1,118poke,Joey, (pause)...Yeah?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I'm not a nice guy.
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Alright boys, let's eat."
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, You still on that?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," You are way off, pal."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timeÂnot any
more. I justÂI..."
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
0,season1,118poke,Ross," You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKÂif you press that
button, you are in very, very big trouble."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Ha. Ha, ha."
0,season1,118poke,Monica, What?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
0,season1,118poke,Monica, Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh, I beg to differ. The <i>Pictionary</i> incident?"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate
slipped out of my hand."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised)
0,season1,118poke,Monica, You're kidding! Where? Where?
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (in disbelief)
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Oh, Rachel!"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Well, what's the job?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
0,season1,118poke,Monica," OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she
was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!"
0,season1,118poke,Aunt Iris, Is Tony Randall dead?
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, No.
0,season1,118poke,Monica, I don't think so.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Why?
0,season1,118poke,Aunt Iris," Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car."
0,season1,118poke,Monica, What?
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Oh my God!
0,season1,118poke,Monica, Really?
0,season1,118poke,Aunt Iris," No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me
tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe)"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Thank y... (thinks about it)
0,season1,118poke,Aunt Iris," Girls, sit down."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
0,season1,118poke,Aunt Iris," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's
do it."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Alright.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Hi!
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Hey.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all
recommending <i>Trident</i>?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked
for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andÂoh, I went to
camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
0,season1,118poke,All, That's great! That's wonderful!
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to
play, we completely understand."
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't
know... <i>Pictionary</i>?"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe and Rachel," Yes, we should. I think we should."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Alright.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen
big ones."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play
that at our regular game."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should
know that this money is cursed."
0,season1,118poke,Joey, What?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way
I can break 'em up with a movie."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I
have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will
win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last
dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,
the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Excuse me, where are you going?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Uh... to the bathroom.
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store
closes at nine, so you can eat then."
0,season1,118poke,Joey, That's fine. I'll just have a <i>Tic-Tac</i> to hold me over.
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Alright. (to Rachel)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)"
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
Coincidence?"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, I'm in.
0,season1,118poke,Monica, Me too.
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Me too. Alright, whattaya got."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down
cards)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down
cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna
make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I
thinkÂohÂthat one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, And your fly's still open...
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Ha, I made you look.... "
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, I couldn't be inner. Monica?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Monica, in or out?"
0,season1,118poke,Monica, (slams down cards) I hate this game! 
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," OK Joey, your bet."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy
with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Ross?
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Oh, I am very in."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Chandler?
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Me too. Rachel.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do
you say... want to waste another buck?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, I'm not telling. (collects chips)
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, No..!
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Show them to me!
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Get your hands out of there! No!
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Let me see! Show them!
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Y'know, I've had dates like this."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your
whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
0,season1,118poke,Ross," First of all, I'm not losing..."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
0,season1,118poke,Ross," (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.
Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if
anything else opens up, pleaÂHello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Sorry, Rach."
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe," Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...
jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Yes, we do. (pause)"
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Alright, check."
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Check.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, Call.
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, I'm in.
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it
in)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross," I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does
anybody have a problem with that?"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (to Ross)
0,season1,118poke,Ross," No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that
'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I'm in. (throws in chips)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, How many you want?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
0,season1,118poke,Ross, I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
0,season1,118poke,Ross," I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," Rachel, there's nothing in it."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," OK, then get me your purse."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," OK, here you go. Good luck."
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (to Monica)
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
0,season1,118poke,Ross, (to Joey)
0,season1,118poke,Joey," That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, (to Ross)
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Fifteen.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)"
0,season1,118poke,Joey," Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)"
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Thank you.
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, Good luck.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, (to Rachel)
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, (lays down cards) Full house.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, You got me.
0,season1,118poke,Joey, (to Ross)
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, (to Ross)
0,season1,118poke,Ross," Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you
know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler," <em>Airplane</em>! <em>Airport</em>! <em>Airport '75</em>! <em>Airport
'77</em>! <em>Airport '79</em>!"
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," Oh, time's up."
0,season1,118poke,Monica," (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE."
0,season1,118poke,Joey, Oh!
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, That's a bird?
0,season1,118poke,Phoebe, That's a bird!
0,season1,118poke,Rachel," OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)"
0,season1,118poke,Chandler, Go.
0,season1,118poke,Ross, Uh.... bean! Bean!
0,season1,118poke,Joey, (triumphantly) <em>The Unbearable Likeness of Being</em>!
0,season1,118poke,Rachel, Yes!
0,season1,118poke,Monica," That, you get? That, you get?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Okay, okay, I checked. We have"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
0,season1,119mga,Monica, What is it?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for
'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Barry who you almost...?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Barry who I almost.
0,season1,119mga,Monica," And Mindy, your maid of...?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.
To have had a friend like you."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good
boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see
he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel
ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, What?
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Hi.
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I
should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Really.
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with
men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right
guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With
Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's
like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone
who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,119mga,Ross, ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Hi, how was the movie?"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Wonderful!
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, So good!
0,season1,119mga,Joey, Suck-fest.
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Toootal chick-flick.
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and
bombs and, like, buses going really fast..."
0,season1,119mga,Joey," Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a
little nudity."
0,season1,119mga,Monica, There was nudity!
0,season1,119mga,Joey," I meant <strong>female </strong>nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou
Grant frolicking."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," They're still just friends, right?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
0,season1,119mga,Ross," That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be
there."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
0,season1,119mga,Joey," I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they
would've happened already?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone
exactly like me."
0,season1,119mga,Joey, She really said that?
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for
someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
0,season1,119mga,Joey, 'Tonight' tonight?
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she
spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over
there and, uh, try to woo her."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the
1890's, when that phrase was last used."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used
to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with
Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the
shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the
newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.
Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment
holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out
in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?
Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the
open door)"
0,season1,119mga,Joey, How could you lose him?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, I don't know. The left one.
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Which <strong>ones</strong>?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, (Entering) Hey. 
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Rachel lost Marcel.
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Oh no, how?"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, He- he pooped in my shoe.
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Which one?
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," No, which <strong>one</strong>? The right or left? 'Cause the left one
is lucky..."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
0,season1,119mga,Joey," Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you
go?"
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of
the touristy things. I'll go to <em>Cats</em>, you go to the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna
kill me!"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second
floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray <em>Lysol </em>in
my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, Whaddyou want?
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles," I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, No!
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, I wasn't ready for it.
0,season1,119mga,Monica, A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, Saw Regis Philbin once...
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)"
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, You owe me a waffle.
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white
face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.
Thanks."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it
here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder
capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we
were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)
Well-"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) "
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Oh, what? What-what?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Y'know Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Ross, ...Yeah?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, See? I've even called Animal Control!
0,season1,119mga,Ross, You called Animal Control?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Marcel is an <strong>illegal </strong>exotic animal. I'm not allowed to
have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Hi, thanks for coming."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his
arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Turned out it was a hat.
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Cat!
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Ross, My uncle Marcel.
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,
punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Yes, but there isn't always time!"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a
seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
0,season1,119mga,Monica, The Luisa from home room!
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Yes!!
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," You have no idea who I am, do you."
0,season1,119mga,Monica," No, none at all."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, None.
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean,
would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?"
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To
Rachel) But you? What a <strong>bitch</strong>!"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, What?!
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that
monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Joey, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Joey, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Woman No. 1," Hi, can I help you?"
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for
something..."
0,season1,119mga,Joey, A monkey.
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Yes have you seen any?
0,season1,119mga,Woman No. 1," No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing
radiators?"
0,season1,119mga,Joey," Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
0,season1,119mga,Woman No. 1, Of course.
0,season1,119mga,Joey," Oh. Then, no."
0,season1,119mga,Woman No. 2, Did I put too much rum in here?
0,season1,119mga,Woman No. 1," Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She
starts to shut the door)"
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about
radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and
cooling... mileu."
0,season1,119mga,Joey," Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're
very hot."
0,season1,119mga,Joey," We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,
but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers
to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us
out."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
0,season1,119mga,Joey, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Marcel?!
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Oh-my-God!
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Whaaat!
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Something just brushed up against my right leg!
0,season1,119mga,Monica, What is it?
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Look, Phoebe!"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)"
0,season1,119mga,Monica, What're you gonna do?
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, Just a small tranquiliser.
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after
him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in
the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah."
0,season1,119mga,Monica, Oh gosh.
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Marcel?
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's
gone, he's-he's just gone."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Ross, you don't know that."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a
sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!
Thank you very much."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the
sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you <strong>happy</strong> now?!"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel
any more!"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort
of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally
oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Ross.
0,season1,119mga,Ross," I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Ross.
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Oh, forget it, okay?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Ross!
0,season1,119mga,Ross, What? What?
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the
other side has no idea."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Hi, did you order some bananas?"
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, What about it?
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Gimme back my monkey.
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, I don't have a monkey.
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Then what's with all the bananas?
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, Potassium.
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross, Marcel! What've you done to him?
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles," That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)"
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles," C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)"
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles," C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to
the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Okay, gimme my monkey back."
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles, That's <strong>my </strong>monkey.
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
0,season1,119mga,Mr. Heckles," That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that
back whenever."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Alright, I want my monkey."
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, No!
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa," Sorry, prom queen."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been
fat."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming
queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!"
0,season1,119mga,Luisa, Nope.
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
0,season1,119mga,Ross," It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel
resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel," Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great.
...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?"
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, That'd be good.
0,season1,119mga,Ross," Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the
main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
0,season1,119mga,Rachel, Barry?!
0,season1,119mga,Ross, We have got to start locking that door!
0,season1,119mga,Monica, This is me in <em>The Sound of Music</em>. See the von Trapp kids?
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe, Nope.
0,season1,119mga,Monica, That's because I'm in front of them.
0,season1,119mga,Chandler, Eh. I thought that was an alp.
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Well, high school was not my favourite time."
0,season1,119mga,Joey," I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex."
0,season1,119mga,Chandler," Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
0,season1,119mga,Monica," Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
0,season1,119mga,Phoebe," Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My
butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much
rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest
snack there is."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see
this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, that is so sick."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, I feel violated. And not in a good way.
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in
disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one
of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, So have you called her yet?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make
disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm
right, right?"
0,season1,120toweo,Joey and Ross," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you
people."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so
testosteroney!"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then
hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, Her answer machine?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," Okay, okay, what's going on?"
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," Okay, they're just talking..."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to
shove anything?"
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, What? What? What?!
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
0,season1,120toweo,All, Oh!... Right!
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Hey Rach!
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, How'd it go?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch
at the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out..."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Not a good day for birds...
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Then we took a walk down to <em>Bendall's</em>, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of <em>Chanel</em>..."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," That's, that's nice twice!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left
at the altar?"
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Duh, where've you been?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Yes!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Why?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, I have my reasons.
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just
happens to be your ex-best friend?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's
stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Wow... Wow!
0,season1,120toweo,Barry, Yeah.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," Nooo, it wasn't."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the
machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs
up.) Oh God!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," <strong>That's</strong> what you've been working on for the past two
hours?!"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Hey, I've been honing!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, What was with the dishes?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I
might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past
few hours."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with
the telescope!"
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in
here!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Great, now he's waving back."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, What kinda stuff?
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm
cooking naked."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, You cook naked?
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
0,season1,120toweo,Barry, What's the matter?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," No, it was. It was very very good."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Well, what about Mindy?"
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," Oh, way, way better than Mindy."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," Well, if you want, I'll justÂI'll just break it off with her."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. "
0,season1,120toweo,Bernice," (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our
honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, I had a bra.
0,season1,120toweo,Bobby," Hey, Dr. Farber."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're
starting to see some real progress here."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, What?!
0,season1,120toweo,Bobby," I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Can I use your phone?
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, Maybe she never got your message.
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe," Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," ...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, How many beeps?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, She answered.
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
0,season1,120toweo,All, Hey! Hi!
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, How'd he take it?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in
your hair?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, do I?"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Uh huh.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," You had <strong>sex</strong> in his <strong>chair</strong>?!... I said
that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, You-you had what?
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Sex in his chair.
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," What, uh... what were you thinking?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history
there. 'S'like you and Carol."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now,"" what would you say? "
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," If it helps, I could slide over."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Where are you going?
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I
have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping
up with it. Okay?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Hello? Hello?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,
yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can
come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All
right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)
Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, So how's Mindy?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta
call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured
that's where you'd be!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Brrrrrrr!
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Hell is filled with people like you.
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, (ducking) Get down!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Get down?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, ...And boogie!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?
I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp
together... she taught me how to kiss.."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, (intrigued) Yeah?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, ..Naughty!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Right, I'll see you guys later..."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to
kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits
and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah..."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Why don't you just take it with you?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Why don't you just call her?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Do you?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.
Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I
accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.
(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna
call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me
back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Don't you have to pee?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, 'S'why I'm dancing...
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Mindy.
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Hey, you."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Sure we should... So.
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend
in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause
she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty
face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Okay.
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Will you be my maid of honour?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Of course!
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Oh that's so great!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Was that all you wanted to ask me?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, That's all!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, That's not all.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Oh sure it is!
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Um, what- what would make you think that?"
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really
weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like <em>Chanel</em>."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I
was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, What? What's what you were afraid of?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a
little thing on the side."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, What?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said ""Don't do
it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,"" and now I feel so stupid."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, What do you mean?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Oh no.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Oh, I am so sorry."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," No me, I am so sorry..."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, (watches them for a while) Oh my.
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, Four letters
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Ring dammit, ring!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, Thanks.
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, What?!
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just
pointing out the irony."
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got
the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Nngghhh!!!!!!!
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney
Marks, please."
0,season1,120toweo,Ross," ""Heating device."""
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Radiator.
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, Five letters.
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Rdtor.
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)
Sidney's a woman."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, So she's a woman! So what?
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking
to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate
it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna
walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
likeÂ(Listens)ÂThank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The
point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Joey!!
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to
Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, The green dress? Really?
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Hey. Got a second?
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in..."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Hello, sweetheart."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry, Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Uh, we are here to break up with you."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry, Both of you?
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should
happen to you."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I
couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Even when we were having sex in that chair?
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!"
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, (to Rachel) You did it twice?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Okay...
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll
start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba."
0,season1,120toweo,Bernice," (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency
here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer."
0,season1,120toweo,Barry," Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,
please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels <strong>great</strong>."
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy, Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!"
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I
still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S."
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Oh God. 
0,season1,120toweo,Mindy," I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still
be my maid of honor...?"
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, You okay?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Really?
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel," Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have
wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
0,season1,120toweo,Monica, Aww... (They hug)
0,season1,120toweo,Joey, Big day.
0,season1,120toweo,Joey," All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's
got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, You know he's gay?
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, I just wanna clarify this
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
0,season1,120toweo,All, Hi. Hi.
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, What are you doing here?
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," ...I'm, I'm okay."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, Okay.
0,season1,120toweo,All, Bye.
0,season1,120toweo,Phoebe, Whoo-hoo!
0,season1,120toweo,Monica," Yeah, there you go!"
0,season1,120toweo,Ross, Second date!
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler, ...I dunno.
0,season1,120toweo,Rachel, You <strong>don't know</strong>?!
0,season1,120toweo,Chandler," Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about
her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only
have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, I know. It's just such reckless spending.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, That's me.
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is
shaking behind the sofa)"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-
(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," What? It's, it's just a phase."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, What?
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, This woman's living my life.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, What?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,
look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that
I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, You're not an artist.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this
stuff. Only I don't."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New
School?"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, (Yawning) Nooo...
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my
mother."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, How about Joey... Pepponi?
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more
neutral."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, Joey... Switzerland?
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like
I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, Might wanna try Joseph.
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the
Fiddler on the Roof."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm
taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, What are you doing?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap
class."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit
card?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,
y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a
weird obsession thing."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, <strong>for the love of God,
Monica, don't do it</strong>!! ...Thank you."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, What d'you think?
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, Lotsa things.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Which one do you think she is?
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher, May I help you?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher, You don't observe a dance class. You <strong>dance</strong>
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, What does she mean?
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, I think she means (Imitates) 'You <strong>dance</strong>
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt
containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, She could be you.
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Okay, I'm not getting this!"
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably
uncoordinated?"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, What? You just click when they click.
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," Alright people, now everyone grab a partner."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Great. It's gym class all over again.
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
0,season1,121towfm,Woman," It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I
am. Who's the new tense girl?"
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher, She's your partner.
0,season1,121towfm,Woman, Hi. I'm Monica.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Yeah. It's Dutch.
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her
something in Dutch)"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, (Mortified) Hi.
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Where've you been?
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, At the vet.
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, So what does this mean?
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, I'm gonna have to give him up.
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult
already?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Isn't there any way you can keep him?
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a <em>Volkswagen</em>."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a
total party zoo."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, What?
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Did you call the cops?
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Nope. We took her to lunch.
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a
stealer."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, ...Take off their hats!
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, Popes in a <em>Volkswagen</em>! ...I love that joke.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, No way. No way did you do this.
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica, Monana was very brave.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!"
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and
have breasts..."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, 'Scuse me?
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing
Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like
you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, What?
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that
changed my life. Did you ever see <em>Dead Poets' Society</em>?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Uh-huh.
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," I thought that movie was so incredibly... <strong>boring</strong>.
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I
walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never
getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the
others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Oh, somebody will."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, (entering) You know there already <strong>is</strong> a Joseph Stalin?
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, You're kidding.
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
You'd think you would've known that!"
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Y'know, you'd think I would've."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, ...Flame Boy.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, Where exactly is your zoo?
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an
interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, Yes.
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," No-no, he's, he's very docile."
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara, Even if he were... cornered?
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Well I, I don't know. Why?"
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, Why- why- why would he need a blade?
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler, ...He's in.
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
0,season1,121towfm,Dr. Baldhara," You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and
good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you
twenty percent of the gains."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Yo- hooo!
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Where the hell've you been?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Are you drunk?!
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been
up here, I've been worried..."
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, Monica? Monica!
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Water rules!
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if
you're gonna be showing up for work?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Nope. Going to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em> today.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not
you!"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the
pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much
more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the
credit card people."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel, What?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, They've arrested Monica.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica, Hey.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, How are you?
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you
know I was here?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica, That I was not expecting.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica, Oh. Thanks.
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I would never have gotten to sing <em>Memories</em> on the stage at the <em>Wintergarden
Theater</em>!"
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without
you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the <em>Big
Apple Circus</em>?"
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other
women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to
being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, Not necessarily...
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica," Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish
thing."
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Um, I'm not actually Amish."
0,season1,121towfm,Fake Monica, Really? Then why are you like that?
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher, You by the door. In or out?
0,season1,121towfm,Monica, In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
0,season1,121towfm,Teacher," You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!"
0,season1,121towfm,Monica," Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe," Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,
but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
0,season1,121towfm,Phoebe, Oh!
0,season1,121towfm,Chandler," Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San
Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Just, just say what you feel."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," Marcel, I'm hungry."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross, That was good.
0,season1,121towfm,Rachel," (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,
y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
0,season1,121towfm,Ross," Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits
beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really
gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to
me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,
Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two
seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey," Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
0,season1,121towfm,Joey, Holden McGroin.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Tell him.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, No.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Tell him, tell him."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Just...please tell him.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Shut up!
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Tell me what?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Look at you, you won't even look at him."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why
women won't look at me."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you
and I, were..."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Wow!
0,season1,122ick,Joey, Exellent dream score.
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Why, why, why would you dream that?"
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," More importantly, was I any good?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," Well, you were pretty damn good."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
(Monica pats him on his lap)"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," I love it, when we share."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, You're okay there?
0,season1,122ick,Ross, I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was
somebody else's subconscious."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Hello Rachel.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Get off.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill
press?"
0,season1,122ick,Joey, I don't know. What are you wearing?
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my
massage clients."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Pirates again?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this
""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is
having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, I could be a secretary.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because
it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, I could do that.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, What are you playing with?
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, it's my new beeper."
0,season1,122ick,Joey, What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still
extinct.'"
0,season1,122ick,Ross," No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I
mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Off to see young Ethan?
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Thank you.
0,season1,122ick,Joey, How young is young Ethan? Young?
0,season1,122ick,Monica, He's... our age.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, When we were?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Okay, he's a senior in college."
0,season1,122ick,Ross, College?
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Well, maybe 25-26."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, I am 26.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, There you go.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Can you hear that?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)"
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a
meeting right now."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your
number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, What?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Ross says hi.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Ah!
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out
there."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, All right. Bye bye.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Bye bye.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Whatcha doin'?
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Ooh. (leans against the desk)
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change
the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause
I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this
guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, What?
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Could tonight be the Night?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you
know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," So, did you shave your legs?"
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Yeah.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, A-ha!
0,season1,122ick,Joey, Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, AndrÃ© is not here.
(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those
kind of services."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,
JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd
be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder
what he means) Me."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Why not?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, What?!
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, I thought you knew that.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, What are you talking about?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got
promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.
Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, I can't belive it.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, They do me?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report <strong>be </strong>any
later?'"
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, I don't sound like that.
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, oh Chandler..."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Oh... Yeah, you do."
0,season1,122ick,Ross, 'The hills were alive with the sound <strong>of</strong> music.'
0,season1,122ick,Joey, (reaches for hi scones) My scones.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so <strong>not</strong> true."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," That is so <strong>not</strong>... That is so <strong>not</strong>...
That... Oh, shut up!"
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Did not.
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that
gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, How was that possible?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held
up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking"
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Unless...
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, What?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Yeah, I'd really like that."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something
you should know."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly
married to a goat?'"
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh..."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Ethan?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Yeah?
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Are you a virgin?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I
am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Really?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?"
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Wow!
0,season1,122ick,Monica, You keep saying that.
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when
you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And
I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, No-no. Nothing wrong about that. 
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Oh.
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. "
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Huh!
0,season1,122ick,Monica," But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what
the hell does it matter how old we are."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another
one for you. I'm a little younger than I said."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, You're not a senior?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Oh, I'm a senior... in High School."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Ok...ay.
0,season1,122ick,Monica," What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't
alive during the Bicentennial."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, I just had sex.
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Well, you never told me how old you were."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48
states. What were you thinking?"
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, ...in love with you.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Really?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, (nods) Sorry.
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school
night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm
Joan Collins."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Who? 
0,season1,122ick,Ross," (on phone) Okay, AndrÃ© should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,
bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," No, forget it."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to
Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."
0,season1,122ick,Joey, All right. (Moves closer.)
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, No.
0,season1,122ick,Ross," You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," No, it was just the three of us."
0,season1,122ick,Ross, Huh!
0,season1,122ick,Joey," So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and
me and Chandler?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, (laughs) You know what?
0,season1,122ick,Joey, What?
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, There were times when it wasn't even me.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
0,season1,122ick,Monica, What?
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Ethan called again.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Oh.
0,season1,122ick,Ross, Are you not seeing him anymore?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get
out of gym."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He
stopped by."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the
strongest <em>Power Ranger</em> is?"
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, yeah."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
0,season1,122ick,Ross, It's morphin time!
0,season1,122ick,Joey, Stegosaurus!
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Tyrannosaurus!
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then
I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Where are you going?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Work people? Nobody told me.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.
Let them see what a great guy you still are."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, You think I should?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," I really do, yeah."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, Okay.
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that
invited the boss."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I
doing <em>Ebony and Ivory</em>."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, You were great. But they still made fun of you.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, What?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring
Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I
wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Then, I don't get it."
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,
the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...
They still say you're a great boss."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, They do?
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, I just wan't to...
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe," No, but you can't."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler, But I just wa...
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Uh uh.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, Aren't you gonna...
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's
having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
0,season1,122ick,Joey, What about AndrÃ©?
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin
Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Hey.
0,season1,122ick,Monica, That was gonna be my opener.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys
check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
0,season1,122ick,Ross, I thought that was just a rumour.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, True story.
0,season1,122ick,Joey, They're here already?
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only
said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have
a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can
talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I
thought that was great."
0,season1,122ick,Monica, It was.
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," Then, what's the problem?"
0,season1,122ick,Monica," Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan, Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
0,season1,122ick,Monica," This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you
were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,
I would really..."
0,season1,122ick,Young Ethan," No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)"
0,season1,122ick,Monica, ...love you.
0,season1,122ick,Ross, Are you're hands still wet?
0,season1,122ick,Joey," Uh, moist, yeah."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Let's dry 'em again.
0,season1,122ick,Gerston," Uh, like, could these margaritas <strong>be </strong>any stronger?
(They discover that Chandler is listening) Hey, Chandler."
0,season1,122ick,Santos," Hello, Mr. Bing."
0,season1,122ick,Petrie, Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my
desk <strong>by</strong> nine o'clock."
0,season1,122ick,Santos, Sure.
0,season1,122ick,Gerston, No problem.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston,
Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
0,season1,122ick,Phoebe, Petrie.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working <strong>this </strong>weekend."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the
pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Ross?
0,season1,122ick,Ross, I'm here.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...Â  Wow!"
0,season1,122ick,Ross," What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, What?
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Ooh, Ooh."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, What?
0,season1,122ick,Ross," I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm
having a... Where's the phone? The phone?"
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, I don't know where the phone is.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel, Ross?
0,season1,122ick,Ross, I'm hurt.
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. "
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
0,season1,122ick,Ross, What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Joey, get out of the fridge."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a huge
sandwich in his hand)"
0,season1,122ick,Ross, What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
0,season1,122ick,Joey, For the ride.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Yeah, like in a cab..."
0,season1,122ick,Ross, Save it.
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Okay, hating this."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
0,season1,122ick,Monica," I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
0,season1,122ick,Ross," That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on."
0,season1,122ick,Joey," All right, I'm going. I'm going."
0,season1,122ick,Chandler," Here we go, here we go."
0,season1,122ick,Rachel," Rossy, Rossy."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not
here."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the
mucus plug."
0,season1,123birth,Joey, Do we have to know about that?
0,season1,123birth,Monica," Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
0,season1,123birth,Joey," I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the
50's."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first
contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, You have to pick your moments.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross, She's not even here yet.
0,season1,123birth,Monica, What's with the guitar?
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get
musical."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
0,season1,123birth,Susan, We stopped at the gift shop.
0,season1,123birth,Carol," I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a <i>Chunky</i>."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Susan wanted a <i>Chunky</i>. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't
stop for <i>Chunky</i>s."
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, I used to have that bumper sticker.
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, (to Rachel) You see what I mean.
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Stopped for a <i>Chunky</i>.
0,season1,123birth,Carol," Let it go, Ross."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," I got an extra one. You want this? (holds the candy in front of Ross'
face)"
0,season1,123birth,Ross, (weakly) No.
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Dr. Franzblau, hi."
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see
you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?"
0,season1,123birth,Carol," Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," 59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," Swiss quartz, ha, ha."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Am I allowed to drink anything?
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, I'll get it.
0,season1,123birth,Susan," No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, I got itÂI'm getting it!
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Thanks.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," And if you need anything else, IÂ(notices the handsome Dr.
Franzblau)Âdo not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...
ex-husband's... sister's roommate. "
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's...
brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Oh, that's funny!"
0,season1,123birth,Monica, I want a baby.
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
0,season1,123birth,Joey," (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good
too."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, Knick fan?
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Oh, yeah."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Oh, boy, do they suck."
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit
water if he was standing on a boat."
0,season1,123birth,Joey, Oh yeah? And who do you like?
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, The Celtics.
0,season1,123birth,Joey," The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!"
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We
need a father!"
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, There is no father.
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!"
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin'
in here."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, Ok.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe, (singing) 
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Thanks, Ross."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe, Ok.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, You'll get one.
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Oh yeah? When?
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
0,season1,123birth,Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," No, no, no."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," (trapped) Uh, uh."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Well?
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)"
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, Hey.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Did you go home and change?
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.
Franzblau been by?"
0,season1,123birth,Monica," No, I haven't seen him."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby
needs him?"
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your
father a doctor? "
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Yeah, why?"
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it
is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean,
Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?"
0,season1,123birth,Joey, Tribbiani.
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you.
Take the phone."
0,season1,123birth,Joey," (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just
friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, She's not much of a phone person.
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if
someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. "
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, Maybe you should.
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? "
0,season1,123birth,Joey, You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Oh, that is so not true."
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Oh, it is."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, It isn't.
0,season1,123birth,Joey, It is.
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, Isn't!
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Breathe.
0,season1,123birth,Carol, You're gonna kill me!
0,season1,123birth,Ross," 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Count faster.
0,season1,123birth,Susan," It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep
focusing on Jordie."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Who the hell is Jordie?
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Your son.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is
Jamie."
0,season1,123birth,Carol," Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to
Jordie."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We
never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan
fiasco."
0,season1,123birth,Carol," Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, I got it.
0,season1,123birth,Susan, I got it.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," No, you don't."
0,season1,123birth,Carol," All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Why?
0,season1,123birth,Susan, He started it!
0,season1,123birth,Ross," No, you started it."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, You did!
0,season1,123birth,Carol," I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're
not making it any easier."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, But...
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Now go!
0,season1,123birth,Ross, (to Susan) Thanks a lot.
0,season1,123birth,Susan, (to Ross) See what you did.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," (to Carol) Yeah, listen..."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Out! 
0,season1,123birth,Nurse," Breathe, breathe, breathe..."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Oh, no."
0,season1,123birth,Joey, Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
0,season1,123birth,Nurse," It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
0,season1,123birth,Joey," (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
0,season1,123birth,Nurse," (to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Please. This is so your fault.
0,season1,123birth,Susan," How, how is this my fault?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
0,season1,123birth,Susan, You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Yes.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you
guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building
and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just
stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Yeah, Susan."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
0,season1,123birth,All, Help!
0,season1,123birth,Ross," I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if
he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Are they here yet?
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find
them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Ok.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, Ok?
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Ok.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it
sounds fascinating."
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by
my hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)
There you go, dear. "
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,
harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,
hey, ho, ho. Let'sÂ (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was
justÂyeah, right. Push! Push! "
0,season1,123birth,Susan," What're you gonna do, suck the door open?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Help! Help!
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," (singing) <i>They found their bodies the very next day, they found their
bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.</i>"
0,season1,123birth,Susan and Ross, (even louder) Help!
0,season1,123birth,Monica," Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is
great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you
don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?
(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. "
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, Where have you been?
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Oh, just had a baby."
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, Mazel tov!
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's
doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you
know, where I do."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, Oh.
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,
when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, I'm a waitress.
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the
end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau, I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
0,season1,123birth,Lydia, So how did you know I was even here?
0,season1,123birth,Guy, Your mom called me. So is this her?
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," No, this is a loaner."
0,season1,123birth,Guy, I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey
smiles) So, did you see who won the game?"
0,season1,123birth,Guy," Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
0,season1,123birth,Lydia," Yeah, they're not so bad."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all
your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is
being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just
as much as you have."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,
ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with
the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
0,season1,123birth,Susan," You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe, This is so great.
0,season1,123birth,Ross, You wanna explain that?
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my
mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to
make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care
about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not
even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm
sorry, you were fighting."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Where are they?
0,season1,123birth,Monica, I'm sure they'll be here soon.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
0,season1,123birth,Joey, Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
0,season1,123birth,Chandler, (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her
hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?"
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
0,season1,123birth,Nurse," All right, honey, time to start pushing."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, But they're not here yet!
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
0,season1,123birth,Carol," Oh, god."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Ok, got the vent open."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker
Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,
three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, What do you see?
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in
fact a dark vent."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
0,season1,123birth,Janitor, (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!
0,season1,123birth,All," Push, push!"
0,season1,123birth,Ross, We're here!
0,season1,123birth,Carol, (irked) Where have you been?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Long story, honey."
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I
needÂ(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have
this?"
0,season1,123birth,Nurse," All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and
there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life
partner, out you go!"
0,season1,123birth,All, Good luck!
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life
partner?"
0,season1,123birth,Nurse, Out!
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?"
0,season1,123birth,Carol, (straining) Not.... helping!
0,season1,123birth,Dr. Franzblau," You're doing great, you're doing fine. "
0,season1,123birth,Ross," (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, What do you see? What do you see?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the
little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!
Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
0,season1,123birth,Susan," Oh, look at that."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, What does he look like?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in <i>Jell-o</i>."
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Really?
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
0,season1,123birth,Susan," No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."
0,season1,123birth,Ross, (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
0,season1,123birth,Susan, I like Ben.
0,season1,123birth,Carol, Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," We uh, we just cooked it up."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, That's what we were off doing.
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Hi.
0,season1,123birth,Ross, Hey.
0,season1,123birth,Monica, Can we come in?
0,season1,123birth,Ross," (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Susan, he looks just like you."
0,season1,123birth,Susan, Thanks.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," I know, I still am one of these."
0,season1,123birth,Monica," Ross, can I?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," The head, the head. You gotta..."
0,season1,123birth,Monica," (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm
your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
0,season1,123birth,Ross," Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be
around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.
(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still
always come back, like this. (returns) "
0,season1,123birth,Chandler," And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
(Does a baseball sign.)"
0,season1,123birth,Monica, He is so amazing.
0,season1,123birth,Rachel," Oh, I know. Look at him."
0,season1,123birth,Joey," Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's
opening his eyes. (picture comes back) "
0,season1,123birth,Joey," He doesn't do much, does he?"
0,season1,123birth,Ross," No, this is pretty much it."
0,season1,123birth,Rachel, You guys wanna get some coffee?
0,season1,123birth,All, Yeah.
0,season1,123birth,Ross," All right, I'll see you guys later."
0,season1,123birth,Phoebe," Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, And here's little Ben nodding off...
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just want to kiss him all over!"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, (quietly) That would be nice.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Pardon?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks
over to where Joey is seated)"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe
me... 17 jillion dollars."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...
research."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, (overhearing) What kind of research?
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Oh, just, y'know.... science."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,
they all look over)"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I
just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,
but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, Hey.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
(hands meat to Monica)"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (in a deep voice) Men are here.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, We make fire. Cook meat.
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Oh, OK."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your
(provocatively) special someone?"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Man's got a point.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, Crazy bitch.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to
the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal
experiments, if you know what I mean."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Joey... we always know what you mean.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Hey.
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe, How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, I'm going to China. 
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, You're going to China?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but
they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to
give us the boÂit'sÂit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for
like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my
itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to
Monica)"
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, (to Monica)
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Yeah.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture
down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I
left."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, No.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," At the coffeehouse, right."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, Hi.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Hey!
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, Hey!
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, (sigh)....I have to go to China.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, The country?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know
who Carl is?"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, Forget about her.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Course there, they just call it food."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Yeah... I guess. I don'tÂI don't know. Alright, just... just give her
this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, I know.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...
I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket
business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're
gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Then you do. Heh, heh."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, What do you mean?
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Y'know, just be there for her."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Not following you.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Think about it.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Well, thank you, Melanie."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...
it's... (opens it) <i>Travel Scrabble</i>! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels
like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!"
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, (to Rachel)
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie, There is a little child inside this man!
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Who's this from?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Oh, that's Ross's. "
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe, Remembered what?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was
a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his <i>Travel
Scrabble</i> game)"
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, I can't believe he did this.
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, What did you just say?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Oh.... my God.
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," I mean, this is unbelievable."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," I know. This is really, really huge."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever
again."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something
about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey)"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (quickly) H-He's in China!
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, The country.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for
another forty-five more minutes."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, What about the time difference?
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, From here to the airport?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, I-I-I don't know.
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the
kind of thing that can wait."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Here, look, alright, does this help?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...
OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, (something in Chinese)
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Hi.
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant, May I see your boarding pass?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant," Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless
you have a boarding pass."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," No, I know, but IÂhe just went on. He's right there, he's got the
blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant, No no no! Federal regulations!
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a
message for me? Please? This is very important."
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant, Alright. What's the message?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Uh... I don't know.
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant," Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
0,season1,124rafo,Man, (confused) What?
0,season1,124rafo,Flight Attendant," It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she
will see you when you get back."
0,season1,124rafo,Man, (to wife)
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a
minute!"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing
his chest)"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give
you another turn."
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie, (surprised) M-Me again?
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Sure! Why not?
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow."
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, How do you mean?
0,season1,124rafo,Melanie," I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys
who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I
ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and
I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm
thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!"
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Another good point.
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, (confused) Huh?
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe," Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Why isn't it working out?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Is he not cute enough for you?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, No!
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Does he not make enough money?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," No, I'm just...."
0,season1,124rafo,Phoebe, Maybe there's someone else.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Wha...
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Is there? Is there someone else?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, No! There is.. there is noone else!
0,season1,124rafo,Monica, Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Hey, big..."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Shhhh!
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, (quietly) ...spender.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, She's still asleep.
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, So how'd it go?
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!"
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was
able to appreciate it on another level."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler, I didn't know you had another level.
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, I know! Neither did I!
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh, from who?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided thisÂthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Oh, why?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be
going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna..."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be
good. I promise."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Who is it?
0,season1,124rafo,Intercom," It's me, Carl."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, C'mon up.
0,season1,124rafo,Monica," Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me."
0,season1,124rafo,Joey, Seven hundred bucks!
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something."
0,season1,124rafo,Chandler," Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
0,season1,124rafo,Joey," What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)"
0,season1,124rafo,Carl," I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid
electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against
environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Fine, just stop thinking about me."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Can't do it, can you?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, So I'm thinking about you. So what?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
0,season1,124rafo,Carl," I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Ross, it's too hard."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade. "
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Ross, you're like my best friend."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, I know.
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," If we broke up, and I lost you..."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you
attracted to me?"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Well, start looking. "
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Wow.
0,season1,124rafo,Carl," Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this
hammerhead in traffic!"
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, Right! You're right!
0,season1,124rafo,Carl, Heh... y'know?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel, You know what?
0,season1,124rafo,Carl, What?
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so
sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her
drink) I meanÂI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. "
0,season1,124rafo,Carl, But...
0,season1,124rafo,Rachel," (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,
sorry. Hi."
0,season1,124rafo,Man," For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
0,season1,124rafo,Julie," Oh, thanks, sweetie."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
0,season1,124rafo,Julie, Really?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross, Yeah. 
0,season1,124rafo,Julie, You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
0,season1,124rafo,Ross," Come on, they're gonna love you."
