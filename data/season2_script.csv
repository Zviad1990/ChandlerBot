0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with
Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of
got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about
her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in
love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet
him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane
with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough
about us. So, how've you been?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.
Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) "
0,season2,201rng,Ross, (seeing her) Rach!
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with
the flowers.)"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, What?
0,season2,201rng,Ross, You're bleeding. 
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.
Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,
thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country."
0,season2,201rng,Julie," (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.
Baggage claim? Ok."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler,  No way!
0,season2,201rng,Monica," I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with
Ross! "
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all
right, what's bigger than huge?"
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Um, this?"
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Yes.
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Guys, you got your hair cut."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look
good. I love that voice."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm
around her. Cramp, cramp."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)
You, you slowpokes!"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my
sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?"
0,season2,201rng,Joey, What up?!
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Everyone, this is Julie."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, (out of breath) Julie.
0,season2,201rng,All, Ohh. (Happily) Hi!
0,season2,201rng,Julie," Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first
impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, And bus.
0,season2,201rng,Julie, Oh my god.
0,season2,201rng,Ross,  The screaming guy?
0,season2,201rng,Julie,  And the spitting?
0,season2,201rng,Ross, You gotta hear this story.
0,season2,201rng,Julie," We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old..."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, 200 at least.
0,season2,201rng,Julie,  ...and this guy...
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away
the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I
can think about."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
0,season2,201rng,Julie," Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
0,season2,201rng,Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. "
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just
kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
0,season2,201rng,Monica, (to Julie) It's an expression.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the
baby."
0,season2,201rng,Julie, And then we've gotta get some sleep.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Yeah, it's really 6"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like
to be surprised."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Yeah, sure."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, Thank you.
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Hey, Rach, can I get..."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, Did you talk to him?
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, Not yet.
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Then, no."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left
you, you were totally in love with, you know."
0,season2,201rng,Ross," I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that
kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, God?
0,season2,201rng,Ross," It was you, pal."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But
then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never
would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Well, you owe me one, big guy."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
0,season2,201rng,Ross, I didn't order lemonade.
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge
you for that. "
0,season2,201rng,Ross, But...
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So
uh, what did you find out?"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm
sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by
himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, How is that the silver lining?
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, You have to really wanna see it.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if
they've changed it?"
0,season2,201rng,Monica," No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," All right, so what were you thinking?"
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I
thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Ohh! No.
0,season2,201rng,Monica, Why not?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control
freak."
0,season2,201rng,Monica, No you're not.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's
Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)"
0,season2,201rng,Ross, (on phone) Hello? Hi.
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
0,season2,201rng,Joey, Needs some clothes altered?
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He
did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All
right, when was 1990?"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
0,season2,201rng,Ross," (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits
down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up
either. "
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, She didn't hang up either!
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y..."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking
to me."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, Okay!
0,season2,201rng,Ross," (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen
to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's
Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with
it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," I'm still on ""no."""
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you
could close your eyes for just a sec?"
0,season2,201rng,Joey," No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, What's goin' on?
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, What stupid thing did you do?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your
way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)"
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Rachel, how did this happen?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Where?
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, At his apartment. Is this juice?
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, People do stupid things when they're upset.
0,season2,201rng,Monica," My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone
looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake."
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching."
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," No, not a problem."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got
pants that need to be altered."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
He'll know what it means."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
0,season2,201rng,Monica," (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair
was so much shorter and cuter."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be
all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
0,season2,201rng,Monica, I promise.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get
cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," All right, that's it, I quit."
0,season2,201rng,Monica, What? I didn't say anything.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who
trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,
doesn't trust a person."
0,season2,201rng,Monica," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we
had discussed."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
0,season2,201rng,Monica, How who wears it?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Demi Moore.
0,season2,201rng,Monica, Demi Moore is not a he.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Well, he was a he in <em>Arthur</em>, and in <em>Ten</em>."
0,season2,201rng,Monica, That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, Oh.  Oh!
0,season2,201rng,Monica, Oh my God!
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
0,season2,201rng,Monica," She's the act<strong>ress</strong> that was in <em>Disclosure</em>, <em>Indecent
Proposal</em>, <em>Ghost</em>!"
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
0,season2,201rng,Monica, <strong>I know</strong>!
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, At least as long as I have the pants.
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, How is she?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, How's the hair?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on
one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
0,season2,201rng,Joey, Can we see her?
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't
you come on in. "
0,season2,201rng,Joey, How're you doing?
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, I'm okay.
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Ooh, that bad, huh? "
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock
bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
0,season2,201rng,Joey, You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
0,season2,201rng,Joey," What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been
in love with you for like 10 years."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," I don't know, I don't know."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been
with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the
way Ross felt about you."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)
Your tailor is a very bad man!"
0,season2,201rng,Joey, Frankie? What're you talking about?
0,season2,201rng,Ross," (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the
shoulder which causes him to jump.)"
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
0,season2,201rng,Ross, What?
0,season2,201rng,Joey, No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand
up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
0,season2,201rng,Ross, What?
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, Cupping.
0,season2,201rng,Joey," That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,
then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler
and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure
pants?"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
0,season2,201rng,Joey, What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
0,season2,201rng,Monica, Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)"
0,season2,201rng,Monica, Thank you. My hair is very amused.
0,season2,201rng,Chandler," Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between
the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Well, can I talk to you for a sec? "
0,season2,201rng,Ross, Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
0,season2,201rng,Joey," Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
0,season2,201rng,Chandler, That's ok.
0,season2,201rng,Ross, What's goin' on?
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a
stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,
second of all (Ross is laughing), what?"
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those
things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next
day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, No. No-no-no-no.
0,season2,201rng,Ross," Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I
actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a
guy like that. "
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," No, I think that was the whole all."
0,season2,201rng,Joey," I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
0,season2,201rng,Julie," I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie
McDowell's new haircut?"
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe, You wanna do it right now?
0,season2,201rng,Julie, Great! (Julie leaves)
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's
the girl from<em> Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, right?"
0,season2,201rng,Rachel," No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy
from <em>Planet of the Apes</em>."
0,season2,201rng,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
0,season2,201rng,Rachel, You're welcome.
0,season2,202brst,Monica," (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were
unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I
couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)"
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,
oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
0,season2,202brst,Susan," Oh, is he hungry already?"
0,season2,202brst,Carol, I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)
something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)"
0,season2,202brst,Joey," (joins him) I gotta get one, too."
0,season2,202brst,Ross, (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
0,season2,202brst,Chandler, We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
0,season2,202brst,Ross," Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in
the world."
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
0,season2,202brst,Ross," This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better
get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask
questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about
breast-feeding?"
0,season2,202brst,Carol, Sure.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Uh, does it hurt?"
0,season2,202brst,Carol," It did at first, but not anymore."
0,season2,202brst,Joey, Chandler?
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," So, uh, how often can you do it?"
0,season2,202brst,Carol, As much as he needs.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get
bigger?"
0,season2,202brst,Julie," Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Yeah, I forget which ones."
0,season2,202brst,Julie," Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? "
0,season2,202brst,All, No thanks.
0,season2,202brst,Julie," (To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you
go. (Ties it back up for her)"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
0,season2,202brst,Julie," Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at <em>Bloomingdale's</em> who's
quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and
take advantage of it?"
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Ok, um, I'll go with you. "
0,season2,202brst,Julie, Great.
0,season2,202brst,Ross," (enters) Hi, honey."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," Hey, sweetums."
0,season2,202brst,Ross, Hello to the rest.
0,season2,202brst,All,  Hi!
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about
Rachel?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," Come on, you're going to <em>Bloomingdale's</em> with Julie? That's
like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
0,season2,202brst,Monica, But I'm...
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
0,season2,202brst,Ross," (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
0,season2,202brst,Ross," It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
0,season2,202brst,Monica, You're welcome.
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Woof, woof. "
0,season2,202brst,Joey," (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?
(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) <font size=""3"">Hey
Annabelle.</font>"
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle," Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
0,season2,202brst,Joey, Who?
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle, Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
0,season2,202brst,Joey, What's he doin' in my section?
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle, I guess he doesn't know.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)
Hey, how ya doin'?"
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man, Mornin'. 
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from
Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man," Your territory, huh?"
0,season2,202brst,Joey, Yeah. Bijan for men?
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man, Hombre?
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man, (To Joey) You were saying?
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe, What?
0,season2,202brst,Monica," We were shopping, and we had lunch."
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Oh, all right. What did I have?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica, You had a salad.
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," (entering) Hey, guys, what's up."
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, You went shopping for fur?
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought
some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, You bought boobs?
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought
bras. "
0,season2,202brst,Joey," (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan
for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,
listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle," Oh, actually I sorta have plans."
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man," (entering) Ready, Annabelle?"
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle, You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?
0,season2,202brst,Joey," (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy
spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and
Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! "
0,season2,202brst,Carol," Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not
before his naps or he won't sleep."
0,season2,202brst,Ross," Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,
we play. It's like we're father and son."
0,season2,202brst,Susan," Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so
surprised. I'm a lovely person."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Oh, this is so cute."
0,season2,202brst,Susan," Oh, I got that for him."
0,season2,202brst,Ross, My mommies love me. That's clever.
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju(Sees Rachel is watching)Hi, Jew! (Walks
into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,
that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes
it. Reaffirms his faith."
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Ben, dinner!"
0,season2,202brst,Ross," Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's
breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her
wrist and tastes it.)"
0,season2,202brst,Chandler, What did you just do?
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," I licked my arm, what?"
0,season2,202brst,Ross, It's breast milk.
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe, So?
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
0,season2,202brst,Joey, What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
0,season2,202brst,Chandler, What did you just do?
0,season2,202brst,Ross," Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe, You won't even taste it?
0,season2,202brst,Ross, No!
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe, Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
0,season2,202brst,Ross, Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Hey, where is everybody?"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks
for your jacket."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the
pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and
notices she also grabbed a receipt.)"
0,season2,202brst,Monica, You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
0,season2,202brst,Monica, That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica, Judy.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, Who?
0,season2,202brst,Monica, Julie.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, What?!
0,season2,202brst,Monica, Jody!
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, You were with Julie?
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she
was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we
were...shopping."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, Oh. Oh my God. 
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Yeah, right.  Sure!"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,
all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)"
0,season2,202brst,Monica, That is not true!
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica, Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to <em>Bloomingdale's</em>?
(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with
you right now. (Exits.)"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as
simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve."
0,season2,202brst,Carol, How did we do?
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
0,season2,202brst,Ross, I did not freak out. 
0,season2,202brst,Carol, Why'd you freak out?
0,season2,202brst,Ross, Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
0,season2,202brst,Carol, My breast milk is gross?
0,season2,202brst,Susan, This should be fun.
0,season2,202brst,Ross," No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think
breast milk is for adults."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler, Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
0,season2,202brst,Carol," Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
(Holding out a bottle.)"
0,season2,202brst,Ross, (jumping away) That would be no.
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe, Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
0,season2,202brst,Susan, Cantaloupe juice.
0,season2,202brst,Joey, Exactly.
0,season2,202brst,Ross, (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
0,season2,202brst,Susan, Uh huh.
0,season2,202brst,Ross," Oh, you've tasted it."
0,season2,202brst,Susan," You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
0,season2,202brst,Ross," (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and
Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it
off.) "
0,season2,202brst,Chandler, Howdy.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a
juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people
on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes
through two bottles a day."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you
care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."
0,season2,202brst,Joey," I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs
the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.
You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And
then where're you gonna run?"
0,season2,202brst,Joey, Yeah I guess you're right.
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made
of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west
of the lingerie."
0,season2,202brst,Joey, I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
0,season2,202brst,Chandler," All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice
hooker."
0,season2,202brst,Monica, I don't know what else to say.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
0,season2,202brst,Monica," I feel terrible, I really do."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend
some time together. Is that so terrible?"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, Yes.
0,season2,202brst,Monica, It's that terrible?
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy
who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually
(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,
just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,
(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, I love you too. (They hug.)
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with
me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and
sits down.)"
0,season2,202brst,Monica," Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to
hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a
guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."
0,season2,202brst,Monica, (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
0,season2,202brst,Phoebe," Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)"
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man, I heard ya.
0,season2,202brst,Store Guy," All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man, Ready.
0,season2,202brst,Joey," Yeah, I'm ready."
0,season2,202brst,Customer," You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
0,season2,202brst,Store Guy," Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?"
0,season2,202brst,Hombre Man," I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle," (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?"
0,season2,202brst,Joey," These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
0,season2,202brst,Annabelle, Sure.
0,season2,202brst,Julie, So.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you
know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,
though, right?"
0,season2,202brst,Julie," I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel, Really? Me?
0,season2,202brst,Julie," Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really
wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the
feeling that maybe you don't."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Well, you're not totally paranoid."
0,season2,202brst,Julie, Oy.
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it
was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but
um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,
Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
0,season2,202brst,Julie," Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or
something?"
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
0,season2,202brst,Julie," I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
0,season2,202brst,Rachel," All right, Julie."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, (entering) Hey.
0,season2,203towhd,All, Hey!
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, So how was Joan?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, I broke up with her. 
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Come on, they were not that huge."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most
superficial insignificant things?"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first
moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser,
but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, (To Ross) You or me?
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," You guys are messing with me, right?"
0,season2,203towhd,All, Yeah.
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Maureen Rosilla.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," ""Cause she doesnt hate Yanni,"" is not a real reason."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," (opening the door) Hello, Mr. Heckles."
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Heckles, You're doing it again.
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, We're not doing anything.
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Heckles, You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, You don't have birds.
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Heckles, I could have birds.
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down."
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Heckles, Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," All right, bye-bye."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about
being picky."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, We'll give you Janice.
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," I miss Janice though. (Imitating Janice) ""Hello, Chandler
Bing."""
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," (doing Janice) ""Oh, my, god."""
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," (doing Janice) ""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There,
faster!"" (He turns around and everyone is staring at him.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, We won. We won!
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, Mr. Heckles.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, How did this happen?
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Treeger, He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, That's terrible.
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Treeger, I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Sure, you coulda. You never know."
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Treeger, You never know.
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.
(Screaming) Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Ok, Phoebe."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. (Everyone groans) That's fine.
Go ahead and scoff. You know there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that
doesn't mean they're not true."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, Such as?
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Nah. Not really.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, You don't believe in evolution?
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a,
it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving
over millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too easy?"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Yeah, I just don't buy it."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is
scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you
know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled
down as I am being pushed."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Treeger," There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr.
Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, What can we do for you?
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Boyle," All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he
wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""The noisy girls in the apartment above
mine."""
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Well, what about his family?"
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Boyle, He didn't have any.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Ok, so let's talk money."
0,season2,203towhd,Mr. Boyle," All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. (To Monica) You be
noisy girl number one, (To Rachel) you be noisy girl number two."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean,
isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, Have you ever seen so much crap?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Check this out. Can I have this? (Its a giant magnifying glass on a
stand.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, How can you not believe in evolution?
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you,
we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of
different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Really? You can actually see it?
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," See, I didn't know that."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Well, there you go."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," (holding a book) Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of
Grievances."""
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with
a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home
with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. (Shes holding a lamp made from
seashells.) Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock or
anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool. (Its a girl in a bikini and
pasties standing behind an alarm clock.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Well, what about my stuff?"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, You don't have any stuff.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, No.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who
rents a room."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, Mmmmm.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a
place for my new lamp."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Ok, Pheebs. (Hes holding two little toys.) See how I'm making these
little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable
thumbs?"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, Please tell me you're joking.
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?
No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the
microscope."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, (To Chandler) Is there blood coming out of my ears?
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Wow, he looks so normal."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, He's even kind of cute.
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," ""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid
in school."""
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Funniest? Heckles? 
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, That's what it says.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. (Theres a
banging coming from upstairs.) He was right. Would you listen to that?"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, I'd call that excessive.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Whoa! 
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, What?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in
the scale modelers club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they
were cool."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," I just think it's weird, you know? (The banging is back.) Heckles and
me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles (He picks up the broom and bangs on the ceiling)
Would you knock it off? (Everyone stares) (Realizes) Bah! (He throws the broom down.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, (entering) Have you been here all night?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with.
Look what he wrote on them. (As he mentions each name and description, he hands a picture
to Joey.) Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she
eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30
years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit
Junction."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come
on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I
dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, How do you know that? How?
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm
gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me
over for holidays?"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what
if we're at her folks' place?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Yeah, I understand."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," (on phone) Hi, it's me."
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," Oh, my, god."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Janice? You called Janice?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," You remember Janice, right?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me.
Janice is my last chance to have somebody."
0,season2,203towhd,Janice, (entering and pregnant) Helloo!!
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, OhmyGod!
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," (To Chandler) Geez, look how fat she got."
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," Hey, it's everybody."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Janice, you're"
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," Yes, I am."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Is it
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married
lady now. (She shows everyone her ring.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Congratulations.
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
0,season2,203towhd,Janice," And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her
fun."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, What?
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, Hide the Lamp.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Monica, let it go."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just
saying that it's one of the possibilities."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross," It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? (Holding her
thumb and forefinger close together) Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the
world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all
thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole
mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that
you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
(Monica and Rachel are intrigued.)"
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, There might bea teenytinypossibility.
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, I can't believe you caved.
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, What?
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't
agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work
tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to
face yourself? (Ross slowly closes the briefcase and walks out hugging it.) Oh! That was
fun. So who's hungry?"
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, I am. Let me just get my coat.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, (running into the living room) What happened?! What happened?!
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on
my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a
sudden, it's just magically broken?"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Phoebe, tell her!"
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want
to believe you."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Ok, you win."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Chandler, you're not gonna die alone."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake."
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, Uh huh. Why is that?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know,
a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man
with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies,
kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,""
they'll shout!"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out
with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel," Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever
gone out with."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, You are not a freak. You're a guy.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different."
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, In a bad way?
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys
don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and
intimate with someone."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe," Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with
someone!"
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, You made it!
0,season2,203towhd,Phoebe, You're there!
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, You are ready to make a commitment!
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, Whoa! Don't know about that.
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll
look good in our apartment."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season2,203towhd,Monica, That's fine.
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow
night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've
been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head.
But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing."
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler, I'll take that.
0,season2,203towhd,Joey, You want his yearbook?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think
somebody should have it."
0,season2,203towhd,Monica," Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this
apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few
moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but he was a person. (She
ends up standing behind the magnifying glass and everyone is laughing.) (Realizes.)You're
all going to hell."
0,season2,203towhd,Rachel, It's really not that big!
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," (To Joey) Takin' that with you, huh?"
0,season2,203towhd,Joey," Oh, yeah."
0,season2,203towhd,Ross, You comin'?
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Yeah, just second. (Ross exits and Chandler picks up the broom and
leans it up against the wall.) Good-bye Mr. Heckles. (He turns off the lights.) We'll try
to keep it down."
0,season2,203towhd,Allison," Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the
classifieds and see ""Philosopher wanted?"""
0,season2,203towhd,Chandler," Sure. (In his head.) <i>My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this
big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work.
All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman
was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a
safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing (a pigeon flies in the window and
lands on the table) <strong>Oh my Goood</strong>, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I
gotta go. (hangs up) OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's
not for you. (grabs a pot and lid) OK, that's fine, read the<em> Family Circus</em>, enjoy
the gentle comedy. (puts pot over the pigeon) Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. (knock at the door) It's open
you guys."
0,season2,204towph,Stranger, Hi.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Hi, hi can I help you?"
0,season2,204towph,Stranger," Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her."
0,season2,204towph,Stranger," Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. (leaves flowers on
bar)"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," What? (in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it
get away)"
0,season2,204towph,Stranger," Hey, how, how did you do that?"
0,season2,204towph,Joey," This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Well, I mean, I'm not <strong>married</strong>, married, ya know, he's
just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We
lived together, we told each other everything."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like,
judgemental and you would not approve."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this
guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I
saw you eat a cheeseburger."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Well, didn't you?"
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, I might have.
0,season2,204towph,Monica, I can't believe you didn't tell me.
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
0,season2,204towph,Monica, What have I not told you?
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there
on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the
terrace."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, What!
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Wait a minute, who told you? (turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish)
You are dead meat."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, I didn't know it was a big secret.
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh
I don't know, having a third nipple!"
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, You have a third nipple?
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, (to Monica) You bitch.
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Whip it out, whip it out."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," (walks into the living room) C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just
a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?"
0,season2,204towph,Joey, I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
0,season2,204towph,Joey," I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it
was. Let me see it again."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, Joey was in a porno movie.
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, You were in a porno?
0,season2,204towph,Joey," Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK.
But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes
in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
0,season2,204towph,Monica, That is wild.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, (to Chandler) So what's it shaped like?
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Yeah, is there a hair on it?"
0,season2,204towph,Joey, What happens if you flick it?
0,season2,204towph,Ross," So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to
the magical land of Narnia."
0,season2,204towph,Julie," You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of
virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state
area?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," (to Monica at the counter) Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But
he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had
to do, I just have to get over it."
0,season2,204towph,Joey, Foxy lady.
0,season2,204towph,Julie, Where you goin'?
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's
in the Capades."
0,season2,204towph,Joey, The Ice Capades?
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when
Snoopy falls. . . funny."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're
setting yourself up all over again."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those
feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice
to look nice for your gay husband."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," (holding cream pitcher) Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. (holds pitcher
in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid) Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . "
0,season2,204towph,Ross," OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
0,season2,204towph,Julie, See you later Rach.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, Bye-bye Julie. (Julie leaves)
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, Hey.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Hey.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Hey?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, What?
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Can I ask you somethin'?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, Sure.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Naa.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," What? C'mon, talk to me."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have,
having the sex?"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are
you and Julie not having sex?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Technically, huh, no."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's
like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean,
uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," No, no no no, don't need to know the details."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my
whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you
know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm
weird."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact,
in fact you know what I think?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross, What?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, I think it's sexy.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Sexy?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man
who does not want to have sex."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, No kidding?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
0,season2,204towph,Ross, What?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, I'd wait.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, You'd wait?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Really?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care
if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That
just means it's working."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Women really want this?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," More than jewelry. (Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself)"
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Hi.
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, Phoebe!
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Ta-da.

0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy.
I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, You always said I'd make it.
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, I missed you. (they hug) I'm gonna get changed.
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, OK.
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Um, now. Phoebs."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Oh, right, OK. Ole."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, What?
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Um, the matador. (Duncan leaves) Ole, ha ha ha."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. (hands her a bowl and
kisses her)"
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Uh, Julie."
0,season2,204towph,Julie, Yeah?
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now,
you're alright."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Hi everyone.
0,season2,204towph,Ross," (pulls Rachel aside) I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little
talk before."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," What did, what did he say?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I
though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to
have sex tonight so. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Pop it in.
0,season2,204towph,Joey," I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two
nippled people. (Chandler puts the tape in)"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, What's wrong with people having sex?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to
women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out
here."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Hell, I wanna see Joey."
0,season2,204towph,Julie," So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh,
never mind."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever
seen."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," All I say is, she better get the job."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
0,season2,204towph,Joey," Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I
can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em
have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) <i>you know that's bad for
the paper tray</i>."
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, Nice work my friend.
0,season2,204towph,Joey," Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's
butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Ohh. . .K. How come?
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Umm, actually, I'm getting married again."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, What?
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Huuh.
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Yeah, I know, I."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're,
you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, So how long have you known?
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was
supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was
just tryin' to fit in."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," And um, and there's actually a, a woman?"
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, Her name's Debra.
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in
college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to
me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. "
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Sure.
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone
for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'"
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," I'm, I'm still me."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
0,season2,204towph,Monica," You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
0,season2,204towph,Julie, That saves us a conversation.
0,season2,204towph,Chandler," Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
0,season2,204towph,Joey," Me too, we should get goin'."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven
thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore."
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Rachel, that's all we do."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?"
0,season2,204towph,Julie, What about Julie?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't
really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We
wanna hear everything."
0,season2,204towph,Julie," Well, that could take a while."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, I got the time to get to know Julie.
0,season2,204towph,Joey, I got time.
0,season2,204towph,Monica," Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? (Rachel gives her a look from
hell) That's fine."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
0,season2,204towph,Julie," Well, in a nutshell. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," So, um, have you told your parents?"
0,season2,204towph,Duncan," No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe," (handing him the papers) Here you go. You know what, I just have one
more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you
think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't
think either answer would make me feel better."
0,season2,204towph,Duncan, I love you Phoebe. (they hug and kiss)
0,season2,204towph,Phoebe, So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
0,season2,204towph,Julie," And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb."
0,season2,204towph,Julie," No Cobb, as in cobb salad."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
0,season2,204towph,Chandler, I'm goin' home.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, What?
0,season2,204towph,Joey," Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Good-night.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . ."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Oh, no-no, I am."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Um, no, I uh, I have done it before."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are
ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?"
0,season2,204towph,Ross," I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Wha, uhh, what?"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the
first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," OK, now I'm nervous."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel, Maybe you should put it off.
0,season2,204towph,Ross," No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year
being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I
mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," I know, yeah, sorry."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," What, it's not your fault."
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were
on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like
that."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Really?
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd
want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good
kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from
my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is
about to happen."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, (being drawn in by her talk) Uh-huh.
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so
that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind
of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
0,season2,204towph,Ross," Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. (goes back in apartment)"
0,season2,204towph,Rachel," Ohh, God."
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Good morning.
0,season2,204towph,Ross, Twice
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Man, I sure miss Julie."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how
you got there. (The phone rings and Chandler doesn't answer it.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, You ever figure out what that thing's for?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if
I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never
gets pinned. "
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, What?
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, I got a little drunk...and naked.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," (answering the phone, in a deep voice) Bob here."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (on phone) What've you been up to?
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and
in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. (They stop
dancing.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (To Ross) I love her.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, I know.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (on phone) I'm back.
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," So, are we gonna get together or what?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh,
Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Great, I'll see you then."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Ok. (He hangs up.) Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees
you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you're not Bob."""
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the
open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Oh my god. You are pure evil.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Ok, pure evil (holds up his left hand), horny and alone (holds up his
right hand). I've done this (He shakes his right hand.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New
Mexico."
0,season2,205fsae,All," Hi, Julie!"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," (sarcastically) Hi, Julie."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his
birthday."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know, like from,
like 20?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Do we need a cake?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates going over a cliff with her hand.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, But it's Ross.
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, It's Ross.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Yeah, you're right."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. (He hangs up) (To Chandler)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," You know, I think I might just."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll
just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just
don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go
there"". Like we can afford to go here and there."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know, someplace nice,
y'know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday
thing, it's for Ross."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, For Ross.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," For Ross, Ross, Ross."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, (entering) Oh my god. 
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Hey.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Hi.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, What?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti,
sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they
fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you
very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should
go out and celebrate. Y'know, someplace nice. (She goes into her bedroom.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," (to Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, someplace nice. "
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season2,205fsae,Joey,  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? 
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional
methods."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is
who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," We don't know Bob!  Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me
be happy."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," All right. (He gets up, but swings around the pole back to their
table.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Go.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Hi. 
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, Hi.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, Yes?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, How did you...
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I don't know. (He sits down.) I just had this weird sense. You know,
but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? (Holds out one of this small packs.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, Thanks.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Ok, (holding up his glass) ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed
head lunch chef..."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Who is also in charge of purchasing.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing...
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there.
Here's to my little sister--"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Cool.
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Let's see!
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," That's fine, I'll-I'll just wait!"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Oh, sorry."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Sorry, sorry."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Monica! 
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, Are we ready to order? 
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet."
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter," Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the
edge of my seat."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," (to Joey and Rachel) Wow, look at these prices."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," What are these, like famous chickens?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm
late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," (to Chandler behind their menus) Well, pretty incredible according to the
message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for
you on my machine?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I
couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's
number."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?"
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, Do I dare ask?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled
prawns. "
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, That sounds great. Same for me.
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, And for the gentleman?
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it
without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter," You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad."
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?"
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, And for you?
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I will have the uh, Cajun catfish."
0,season2,205fsae,Waiter, Anything else?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Yes, how 'bout a verse of <em>Killing Me Softly</em>. You're gonna
sneeze on my fish, aren't you?"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler,  Okay.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Um, everyone?"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. "
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Thank you.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. "
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Oh, thank you!"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber
mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that-that-that salad, and, and Joey
with his like teeny pizza! It's just..."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big
deal."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Not for you.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," All right, what's goin' on?"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," (to Joey and Phoebe) Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into
this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Fine. All right, fine."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Yeah.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, You can tell us. 
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Yeah!
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," (clearing his throat a lot) Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh,
sometimes you guys don't get that uh... (Pause) We don't have as much money as you."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Ok.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, I hear ya. 
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, We can talk about that.
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Well, then...Let's."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Well umm I, I just never think of money as an issue."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, That's 'cause you have it.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, That's a good point.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like with Monica's new job, or the
whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," WhaWhoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind
of negativethere's gonna be a hoopla?"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the
thing."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and
we'll just do the gift."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Hootie and theoh my. I, I can catch them on the radio."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be
together."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, All of us.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Together.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Not at the concert.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Ok.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Yeah.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Thanks.
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Oh, it's like a skit."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. "
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Whoo!
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Cool.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the
steaks as sort of a thank you."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," (to the others) By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Come on.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! (Pause) The
Blowfish!"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, So...Thank you.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Could you be less enthused?
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like..."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Like?
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Charity.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Charity?
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this
big. (Holds her thumb and forefinger a short distance apart.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Actually, it makes us feel that big. (She squeezes Rachel's thumb and
forefinger closer together.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you
guys."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," If you guys feel this big (imitates Rachel's gesture), maybe that's
not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie
place right now."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Me neither.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Me too.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Guys, we bought the tickets."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and
stuff."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (to Phoebe) Why did you look at me when you said that?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Well, I guess now we can't go."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do
everything together?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, You know what? You're right.
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Fine.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Fine. (Exits)
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Fine.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Fine. (Exits)
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Fine.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," All right. We're gonna go. (Exits, then comes back in) It's not for
another six hours. We're gonna go then."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Chandler! 
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (startling Ross) Yeah?
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Geez! Are you ready?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Whoa! You had sex today?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome,
ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. "
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Wow!
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, Still doing the screening thing?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really
hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a
guy."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (answering the phone) Bob here.
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Oh, hi."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. (Chandler and
Ross dance in joy.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," So, uh, how was he?"
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, Eh.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Eh?
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from
screaming your name."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Well, that makes me feel so good."
0,season2,205fsae,Jade, It was just so awkward and bumpy.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, (silently mouthing) Bumpy?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not
familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I
mean?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," So, let's go."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them (the band) for us to leave now."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," (holding a hand behind his back) Come on you guys, one more time."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Ok. One.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, Nooo. (He brings out his hand and is holding up two fingers.)
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, That was amazing!
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Excellent, that was excellent."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, I can't believe the guys missed this.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," What guys? Oh, yeah."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, Do I know you?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
0,season2,205fsae,Steve," Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
0,season2,205fsae,Steve," Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Uh, wait, backstage?"
0,season2,205fsae,Steve," Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross, (introducing himself) Ross.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, (introducing himself) Chandler.
0,season2,205fsae,Steve," How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you
one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?"
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Hey, you guys."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Happy birthday.
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie
Fisher. Remember him?"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Uh, good."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Yeah, we really missed you guys."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey," Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money
get(notices something on Monica's neck)Is that a hickey?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," No, I just, I fell down."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," You know, a party, or..."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, What party?
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," It wasn't so much a party as a...a gathering of people, with food, and
music, and, and the band."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," Yes, apparently Stevie and Hootie are like this. (Holds up crossed
fingers.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Who gave you that hickey?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica, That would be the work of a Blowfish.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Oh!
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe," Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting
at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having
fun, and you know, all, ""Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
0,season2,205fsae,Ross," Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know."
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel," What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Oh great, it's work. (To Ross) Can you hand me that? (Ross hands her the
phone.)"
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you.
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. "
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, And we don't work hard?
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page."
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler," I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little
more."
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, And you feel like we hold you back.
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, Yes.
0,season2,205fsae,Rachel, Oh!
0,season2,205fsae,Chandler, No.
0,season2,205fsae,Monica," Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. (They quiet down.) Wait, I don't understand.
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just
replace them and we can forget the whole thing. (Listens) What corporate policy? (Listens)
  No. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) I just got fired."
0,season2,205fsae,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season2,205fsae,Waitress, (To Monica) Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
0,season2,205fsae,Joey, (grabs the check) Let me get that. (To Chandler) You got five bucks?
0,season2,205fsae,Jade," Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It
has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have
one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night..."
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. (Ben
starts crying.) Don't cry. Don't cry. (To Ross) Why is he still crying?"
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Maye it's me.
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)
0,season2,206baby,Monica, There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica,
Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying. He does that a couple times.)"
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Cool.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, He hates me. My nephew hates me.
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Come on, don't do this."
0,season2,206baby,Monica, What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna
be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a
boyfriend yet. (Monica glares at him.) Joey, she does not look fat."
0,season2,206baby,Monica, (to Chandler) Here you go. (Sets a drink down in front of him.)
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Oh hey Monica. (He holds the basketball in front of Monica.)
0,season2,206baby,Joey," (imitating Ben) Waah!! (Chandler moves the basketball away) Goo, goo, goo.
(Chandler moves the basketball in front of Monica again.) Waaah!"
0,season2,206baby,Monica," That is so funny. Let me see that a sec. (She throws the ball out the
window)"
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Are you ok, Ross?"
0,season2,206baby,Ross, I don't know. What's in this pie? 
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi..."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Kiwi? Kiwi? You said it was a key lime pie.
0,season2,206baby,Monica," No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. "
0,season2,206baby,Ross, And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
0,season2,206baby,Monica," No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and..."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Ugh.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Oh my god.
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Is your tongue swelling up?
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
0,season2,206baby,Monica," All right, get your coat, we're gonna go to the hospital."
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Is he gonna be ok?
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot."
0,season2,206baby,Ross," (sitting back down) You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It
is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?"
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Jacket now.
0,season2,206baby,Ross, What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
0,season2,206baby,Joey, We'll watch him.
0,season2,206baby,Ross, I don't think tho.
0,season2,206baby,Joey," What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's
out the window."
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his
hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag."
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Hat, milk, got it."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro throa thro thro!
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Consider it done.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, You understood that?
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this
afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Ok.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," (singing) <em>I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if
you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is
Nirget.</em>"
0,season2,206baby,Terry," Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, What's up?
0,season2,206baby,Terry," F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on
Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, But what about Phoebe?
0,season2,206baby,Terry," Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she
makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to
her."
0,season2,206baby,Terry, Uh... (Points at Rachel.)
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," (singing) <em>Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and
lather, rinse, repeat...as needed.</em>"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to
pack the baby's anvil?"
0,season2,206baby,Joey," It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all
right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at
that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get
them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," No, I got him."
0,season2,206baby,Joey," No, seriously."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Oh, seriously you want him?"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
0,season2,206baby,Joey, You wanna smell him?
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
0,season2,206baby,Joey, (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Well, we are great guys."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written
out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Honey, I'm sorry."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her
like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a
jerk!"" That's where that came from."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. "
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. (She goes
over to Terry.) All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie
whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna
cost you anything."
0,season2,206baby,Terry," I, I don't know. "
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine."
0,season2,206baby,Terry, You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will
cleeeean it."
0,season2,206baby,Terry," Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Done.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Really?
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, What?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause
she's a professional."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Well, but Pheebs..."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity
band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be
happy to pay to hear me play. "
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," (singing, angrily) <em>When I play, I play for me, I don't need your
charity</em>. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la...."
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle
and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. "
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight
phobia about needles."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, (to Monica) Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
0,season2,206baby,Monica," My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this
orally. "
0,season2,206baby,Doctor," No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to
be now."
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Tho?
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Ohhh.
0,season2,206baby,Monica," That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?"
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Ok.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? 
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Yes!
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Okay. (He grabs her hand.) All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! (The doctor puts in the needle.) Oh, Ross! Let go
of my hand!"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should
just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!"
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Hey, hey, look at that talent. (Motions to two girls waiting for the bus.)"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Wait-wait-wait-wait!
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Wait!  Wait!
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink."
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging
with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, (to Joey) You done?
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Get outta here. This is our stop too.
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, You know it?
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get
together for a drink?"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Oh, sure, they love us over there."
0,season2,206baby,Joey,  Ben!
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
0,season2,206baby,Doctor," No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here (pointing to the
X-ray) is the puncture wound from your ring."
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's
back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. "
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," (singing) ...<em> with the double double double-jointed boy</em>. (A
woman carrying a guitar case walks up.) Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar
player?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Right. My name was on there (The chalk sign out front), but now it just
says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, All of them. 
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Oh yeah, so you know D?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Ok, do you know A minor?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, No.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Oh. Mine does. (singing) <em>Stephanie knows all the chords</em>. (makes
a face)"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority?
Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if
they left a baby on a city bus. (Listens) Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid
character."
0,season2,206baby,Joey," (grabbing the phone) Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus
today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a
baby in it. (Listens) (to Chandler) He wants to talk to you again."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to..."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," (outside singing angrily) <em>Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work,
and I hate Central Perk</em>!"
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer."
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie," Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first
man I ever loved. (singing) <em>Zachary</em>."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, (singing/screaming) <em>You're all invited to bite me</em>!
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, That's me.
0,season2,206baby,Joey, I'm him.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And
Ben was definitely wearing ducks."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Ok.
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that
cute little mole by his mouth."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Yeah?
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off."
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Ahh!
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
0,season2,206baby,Joey, You got a better idea? 
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," All right, call it in the air."
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Heads.
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, Heads it is.
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Yes! Whew!
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, We have to assign heads to something.
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler, What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie," (singing) <em>Just call me angel of the monring.  Angel! 
Just touch my cheek before you leave me. Oh baby.  Just call me angel of the morning.
  Angel!  And slowly turn away.  I won't beg you to stay, with me.</em>"
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Hey.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Oh, hi."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Here. I thought you might be cold. (Hands her a cup of coffee.)
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Thank you.
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first
two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel, Do you?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You
know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide,"" I got a dollar seventy-five.
But then, ""Smelly Cat,"" I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just
feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You
know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! (Waves her
hand over her head.)"
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but
now it's like, it's just all about the money."
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a
request for ""Smelly Cat."""
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Really? From who?
0,season2,206baby,Rachel," Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my
favorite."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Yeah. Here you go.
0,season2,206baby,Ross," I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I
almost broke your hand."
0,season2,206baby,Monica, That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?"
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? (Points to her hand.)"
0,season2,206baby,Ross, Oh.
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's
pumpkin?"
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you
flipped over and hit your head on the curb? "
0,season2,206baby,Monica, No. But I remember people telling me about it.
0,season2,206baby,Ross, I hope Ben has a little sister.
0,season2,206baby,Monica, Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
0,season2,206baby,Ross," I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off
your Malibu Ken?"
0,season2,206baby,Monica, That was you?!
0,season2,206baby,Ross," They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it."
0,season2,206baby,Monica," Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben.
Hey, my little boy. (She picks him up.) Hey, he's not crying."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying."
0,season2,206baby,Joey, Yes! (Monica looks at him.) There's still pie.
0,season2,206baby,Ross," I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did
you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?"
0,season2,206baby,Joey," Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
0,season2,206baby,Ross," Ohhh. Big boy, riding the busHey, I have a question. How come it
says Property of Human Services on his butt?"
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," You, you are gonna love this. "
0,season2,206baby,Ross," (to Monica) Will you hold Ben for a sec? (Hands Ben off and starts to
chase Joey and Chandler.) Come here. Come here."
0,season2,206baby,Chandler," (picking up the pie) Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie," (singing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you</em>?"
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""<em>smelly cat, smel-ly cat</em>."""
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie," <em>Smelly cat, smel-ly cat</em>..."
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Better. Yeah.
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a
hard song."
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah. 
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, You wanna try it again?
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Yeah. From the top?
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe," Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you
just follow me?"
0,season2,206baby,Stephanie, Ok.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, Mmmm hmmm.
0,season2,206baby,Phoebe, That's too much. Sorry.
