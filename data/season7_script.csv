0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Hey, whats going on?"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Hey.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," I found a note on my door, ""Come to Monicas quick, bring
champagne and a <i>Three Musketeers</i> bar."""
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, (grabbing the candy bar) Yeah Ill take that.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Whats up?
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Monica and I are engaged.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Thanks.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Where is she?
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (yelling at the top of her lungs) Im engaged!!!!!! Im
engaged!!!!"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Yeah, shes been out there for twenty minutes, Im surprised you
didnt hear her on the way over."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, ""Im gay! Im
gay!"" Can I bring her in?"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Oh no, let her stay out there. Its sweet."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Im getting married!!!! Im gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else
yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because Im engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big
talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my
fiancée will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20!
Apartment 20!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door.
Ill be in the closet."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a
toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say thatI love you guys so-so much and-and thank you
for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I
mean it just wouldnt be myour-our night, if you all werent here to
celebrate with meusDamnit!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Its okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.)
To Monica."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Awww, come onwaitstop it. Okay, to Monica."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, To Monica!
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, yknow,
Im kinda musical."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt
shes even had time to"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my
apartment?"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," (To Monica) Yeah, youre on your own."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Yknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to
have champagne at <i>The Plaza</i>."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," But I-I-I cant stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial
audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Im supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, You guys dont think I look 19?
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Okay everybody, lets go! Lets go!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Oh honey no, you ate it all."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, I was afraid of that. 
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (looking at her hand) Yknow what shoes would look great with this
ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youre not getting dressed.
(Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Know what I mean?
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Yeah, but I dont think we have time."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Two
hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (lustily) Lets do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the
bed.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you
were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (motioning with his hands) Im not worried, Im uh, Im
fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school
I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her
room with her guitar.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
(Singing) <i></i>"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Phoebe!
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes
probably not gay."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood.
(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, You look great!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," (quietly) Oh, thanks."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, You okay over there?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No,
yknow what? Never mind, Im gonna be fine."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had
a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Wow! Happy Monicas night!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Well thank you, you too."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Thanks.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting
married?"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Well sure. But I get married all the time so
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel,  Oh
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, You okay?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yeah, I guess. I-I I mean, do-do you think were ever gonna
have that?"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," You mean, weyou and me?"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Oh good, you scared me for a minute."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Shake it off.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," I meanno, its just cause, its just cause you
and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," No, absolutely. Yknow like it was umm"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Surely you can think of something good.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one
good thing."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, What?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, My hands?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," (to his hands) Way to go guys. Yknow, you-you were really good at
the stuff too."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Oh, I know. Hey, yknow what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh
no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, A what?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yknow, bonus night. Yknow, when two people break up but they
get back together for just one night."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, we never had that,"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, No.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, Im-Im sure it
would be amazing but Igotta say I really-really dont think it would be a good
idea. Yknow? I really, reallydont."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Sup? Sup dude?
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please dont
hurt me."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," So youre playing a little <i>Playstation</i>, huh? Thats
whack! <i>Playstation</i> is whack! Sup with the whack<i> Playstation</i>,
sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,
you are definitely 19."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Come on man, really how old?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because
everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Joe?
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Yeah!
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler,"  Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," When? Today? Some, not a lot."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind
of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Dont worry about that man, that happens."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Its happened to you?
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Yeah! Once.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Well, whatd you do?"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, I did it anyway.
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Phoebe! Come on! Lets go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe
enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arent you dressed yet?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.
Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if
you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding."
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Really?! Oh thats so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,
if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Fair enough, now go get ready!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Ill get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating
my(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)
Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, What?
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," See, Ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some
people Im only planning on doing this once. So, uh yknow, maybe this is
selfish and Im sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about
that."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Oh honey, but it is just about"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, It is! It is!
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," No its not! No! No! Now its about you and Ross getting back
together!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not
getting back together!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Yeah!
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Thats true.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Honey I swear it we just kissed. 
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting
back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Thunder being stolen!!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Okay come on Phoebe, its nothing! Monica, come on!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Look lets not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time
thing. It doesnt even matter!"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems
in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the
best he can!!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (angrily) I dont think thats what they were talking about
Joe!!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," What a great night, Chandler cant do it, these guys kissed
(Points to Ross and Rachel.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, What? 
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, What?!
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, You guys kissed! Oh mythis is huge!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, No!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Oh no!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," No-no, its really not huge."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," And; people thinking its huge has led Monica to believe that we
are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Well, were still talking about it, arent we?"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Well yeah, that and Chandlers problem."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it
make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Yes that would be lovely.
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Yes, you can pass for 19."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Really?
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Yes!
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Seriously?
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, (gasps) Im 30!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Joey, you are not! Youre 31."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, (realizes) Aww crap!
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Okay, so <i>The Plaza</i>! Okay, well get us some Mai Thais,
(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Yknow what? I-I think that umm, I dont feel like going to <i>The
Plaza</i>."
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, Why?!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," No-no, I-I really dont want to talk about it! I dont! (To
Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Psss, that is whack!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," (shes strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think
Ill play it at the wedding."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Yeah! Well, I think well see if they actually let you play. Huh? I
mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then
they just take it away like-like, ""No you dont."""
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Well, I dont think Monica is gonna take this away."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, Wouldnt she?
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, Would she?
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You
ate my candy bar!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Guess who? (Enters fully.)
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Hey.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," What do you think Monica meant when she said she didnt want to
talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there
kissing."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Still thinking about it huh?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?
(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, I care!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, (tightening his tie) And so do I.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get
changed?"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Am I going to let you watch me undress?
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," I cant believe her, yknow its justits so
typical."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is
going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres
going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Paris?
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Keep talking.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just
because its romantic, but because I can!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, I love you!
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Its Paris, who knows were here!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whats up? (She enters.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Im just gonna need
a small deposit."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, What?!
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," They break your heart, dont they?"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Yknow, I dont really need their permission."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey," Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you You gotta do something
about your eyes."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, What?! Whats wrong with my eyes.
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," They give you away! Theres just-theres just too much wisdom
in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes."
0,season7,701towmt,Joey, And thatll get rid of my wisdom?
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Yes.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to
talk to anyone, especially me?"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Well, lets just say its not the first time youve
stolen my thunder."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," (To Rachel) Hey, heres a thought."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Monica, what are you talking about?"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin
Charlie."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (entering) Ahh, third base."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Its all everybody at the party could talk about!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Monica, yknow what? The only reason I did that was because your
party was so boring!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, (gasps) We had a caricaturist!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Oh!! 
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," (singing, angrily) "
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," And yet, here we are doing it again."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Ugh, Monica I dont want to steal your stupid thunder!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonna
happen!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us getting
together tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from
your night?"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," I dont know! I dontmaybe youre feeling a little
resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! Maybe you cant
stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Oh wow. Thatyknow what? That is so unfair. Yknow what?
Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, lets go have sex!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (yelling after them) I cant believe youre gonna have sex on
my engagement night!!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Look uh, if were gonna do this"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Were not gonna do this, all right? Shes just gonna think
that were doin it."
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," Oh, I see, so everybody wins. "
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Who is it?
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (outside the door) Its Monica, open up!"
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to
follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross, Oww!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May
we help you?"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that
you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your
engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, How is that ever going to happen?!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!"
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, I know why!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, No you dont know why!
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, Okay! Why?!
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Because! Because I was sad.
0,season7,701towmt,Monica, What do you mean?
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just
reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know,
maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but oh
my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (To Ross) I dont care, she slept with me."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel," Anyway sweetie, I am, Im so sorry I ruined your night."
0,season7,701towmt,Monica," (starting to cry) Im sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
(They hug.)"
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," (deadpan) Well, Im going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations
man."
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Thanks.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," (at the door) And uh, Rachel."
0,season7,701towmt,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,701towmt,Ross," What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person
whos going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes
what he said and exits disgustedly.) "
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, (singing)<i></i>
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler," (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Heres a dollar, consider it
a deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe, Oh thank you.
0,season7,701towmt,Chandler, Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
0,season7,701towmt,Phoebe," Now (Starts singing again) ""<i>Who will perform the ceremony!
Who will perform the cer</i>(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the
door behind him)Ohoh! All right, Ill pound on him in the morning."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, Hi!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Who wants French toast?
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Oh, Ill have some!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.
Thanks."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, (entering from her room) Oww!
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Whats the matter honey?
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," I dont know, my hand feels weird. I guess its because,
Im engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, It starts?
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Yeah, so lets get started on the wedding plans!"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Okay! (Runs off.)
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, (incredulous) Already?!
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the
caterers, the music"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say
the right name."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3"" 3-ring binder on the table.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, What in Gods name is that?!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Oh my God, the wedding book?! I havent seen that since the forth
grade!"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," This baby has got everything. Take yknow, locations for instance.
(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then
geographically, then by square footage. "
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it
off now."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for <i>Jurassic
Park</i> first! Now lets take a look at (Phoebe rushes in.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, Hey! Ross!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica
and Chandler."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please
excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each others hometowns? Why dont
you (Motions that they should learn everyones hometown.) (To Phoebe)
Wh-whats going on?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just
got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? So, could I
just move in with you for a couple days?"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, NothingWhy?!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five
minutes."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," (to the students) Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want
to come to the movies?"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," All right, so I havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but
tell me how this is for music."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Aw.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," A jazz trio for cocktails. The <i>Bay City Rollers</i> for dancing.
Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt
play anymore
and Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name I
shouldnt know."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up
one.) Yknow, something a little snugglyer?"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Well, the duck"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was
immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are
actually involved in the wedding?"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Centerpieces!
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just
think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)
But Lilies are the clear choice."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Oh my God! Its like one mind.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Uh-huh!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, Im
gonna get cranky!"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck
got sick!"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," All right, Im gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Now Joey, what did the duck do?!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, I dont know! But he did not eat your face cream!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick
and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream?
(Hes about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachels room. He walks
into her room and feels the bed.) Thats so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.)
Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him
and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.)
(In his head.) <i>Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar</i>(Stops
reading and thinks.) <i>The vicar? </i>(Continues reading) <i>wouldnt be home
for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and
grabbed his</i>(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a
dirty book! (Continues to read.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Uh, Phoebe"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Oh Ross, hi."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Im sorry, Im with a client right now."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, Phoebe!
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Okay, lets talk outside."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment!"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, Whats the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandlers!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, And they knew about it?
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I
want!"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I
just dont know what the big deal is!"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment
when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Hey Joey, what cha doing?"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, No.
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Joey, did you  eat my face cream?"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, (gasps) You found my book?!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Yeah I did!
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I
shouldnt have, but you got porn!"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Hey-hey, yknow what? I dont care! Im not ashamed of my
book. Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. Its just a
healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She
goes into her room.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, You got porn!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, Hello.
0,season7,702towrb,Woman," Hi, is uh Phoebe here?"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Uh no-no, she-shes out for the night."
0,season7,702towrb,Woman, Ohh great.
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Can I, can I help you with something?"
0,season7,702towrb,Woman," Well, I dont know. Are you a masseur?"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, (deadpan) Yes I am.
0,season7,702towrb,Woman," Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so
much, Ill be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.) "
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when
you told them you were engaged."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller, I remember when we first got engaged.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Oh dad, really you dont need to"
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller," (ignoring her) Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still
dont know how that happened."
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," (incredulous) You dont know how that happened?! Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, What a sweet story.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your
fifth grade Halloween party."
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller, What?! They wanted a scary story!
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I
guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
(She and Chandler laugh, but her parents dont.) What?"
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," You tell her Jack, I cant do it."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller," We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, I dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," Were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married
after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, You bought the beach house when I was 23!
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller," Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put
a price on that sweetie."
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller, We really do feel bad about this though.
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller," We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that
went to hell, so we redid the kitchen."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, What about when I started dating Chandler?
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever
propose!"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," We might still have some money, if your father didnt
think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet."
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller, It seemed like such a simple idea.
0,season7,702towrb,Mrs. Geller," Stupid Jack, the word is stupid."
0,season7,702towrb,Mr. Geller," All right, enough! I dont want to hear about it anymore!
(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Okay! Now, Im going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,
thats soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage
him with those.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay
for it?"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth
wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he
saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) <i>Dollywood</i>."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Well what happened at dinner?
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, My parents spent the money for our wedding!
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, (gasps) My God! What did you order?!
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are
gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Honey, its gonna be okay."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing
band! No lilies!"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont
have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you
dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off
the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love
each other and that were gonna get married."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, How? I dont have any money.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, I have some."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, How much?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to
write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.) "
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Well what?! How-how much is it?!
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Its enough for wedding scenario eight.
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the
amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the
wedding?"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I
kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.
Chandler."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, This is the most special day of our lives.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the
money on one party."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a
party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always
earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer
is no."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Yes, I am!"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Hey Rach.
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, (quietly) Joey.
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," No-no-no, Im serious. You dont smell it? Somethings on
fire."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Well no, I dont smell anything."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Oh, yknow what? Its probably just your burnin loins."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Nothing!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," (takes a drink) Damn, this coffees cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I
heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Yknow, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with
you. (Exits.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons
of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) Sup?"
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) Im sorry?
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy
that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe, He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him
acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a
mop."
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Well, hes never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars
a week!"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," Hey, yknow what? This is your fault! Youre the one that
didnt move his-his appointment."
0,season7,702towrb,Phoebe," Oh, its my fault?! You didnt have to massage him! You
couldve sent him away! You couldve not rolled<i> Tonka</i> trucks up and down
his back!"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross," He said he liked that!! Oh youre right, youre right. Im
sorry."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
0,season7,702towrb,Ross, His daughter was hot.
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Gotcha.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Hey.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Hey.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask
you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for
that."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Ehh.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Eh, you work for that."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should
spend all of the money on the wedding."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, You do?!
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told
you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes
you happy then, then thats what were gonna do."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," Oh, youre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about
our, what about the future and stuff?"
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,
yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, You thought about that?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, What else did you think about?
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place
outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow,
we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it
ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old."
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," (laughs) Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, Sure you do.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, You sure?
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Uh-hmm.
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler, I love you so much.
0,season7,702towrb,Monica," I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were
talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."
0,season7,702towrb,Chandler," Oh yeah, totally!"
0,season7,702towrb,Monica, Oh good.
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Hello, Zelda."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Who are you supposed to be?
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, The vicar!
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Do you even know what a vicar is?
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Like a goalie, right?"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, its enough alright?! You keep
making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and itsIm
notits just not funny anymore!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," All right, Im sorry. Rach IRach Im sorry. Okay? Im
sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," All right! Yknow what? Thats it! You wanna do it?!
Lets do it!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, Huh?
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," (starting to move closer to him) Thats right, I wanna do it with
you! Ive been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things."
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, Ive been waitin
so long to get on that body!"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey, This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel, Yeah thats right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," Hey-hey, youre startin to sound like the butchers wife
there in-in chapter seven."
0,season7,702towrb,Rachel," Oh, come on now, dont keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,
I would keep that helmet on because youre in for a rough ride! (He backs into
the door.)"
0,season7,702towrb,Joey," I dont want to, Im scared."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Hey, you guys!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," So, what do you think?"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, About what?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yeah, what?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, What?
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Are you kidding? Okay, Ill give you a hint; Ill give you a
hint. (Points to his glasses.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, I got glasses!
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Well, you-youve always had glasses."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, No I didnt!
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Are you sure?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, did-didnt you use to have a pair? They were really
round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Feminine.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Yes!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, No!
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Really?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Yeah!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnt think I used to
wear glasses, right?"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Of course! (She mouths, ""I have no idea,"" to the rest of the
gang.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so
you dont have to get us"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we dont
want to deprive them of that joy."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Oh, yknow what you should get em? One of those little uh,
portable CD players."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Oh, I already have one. "
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Hey, I know what I want!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, What we want honey.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," No, you dont want this. I want to have your grandmothers
cookie recipe."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Uh-huh, yeah."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that
I would never let out of our family?"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Dying people say the craziest things.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Break my heartOh, all right."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best
chocolate chip cookies."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, (entering) Ahoy!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Hey! Hows the boat?!
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Great! Im finally getting into this sailing stuff.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," If you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang
around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks
a beer, and eats a chip.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, You could?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad
bought me my own boat."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Your own boat?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Do you know what I was thinkin?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, What?
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," No, why?"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Then free as a bird. Whats up?
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Wow! Thats great! Dad must really like you, he doesnt ask
just anyone to play."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed
he meant you."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Well, did-did you correct him?"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the
trash cans. He does that every week too."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Yeah.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, He hates to lose.
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Youre not a lefty? 
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Does anybody know me?!
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Whats wrong Phoebe?
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the
stupid fire burned it up!"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box
and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Im normal!
That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an
engagement present."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Dont worry about it Pheebs.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, No one got me an engagement present.
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie
in a plastic baggie.) "
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, An old cookie?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," (To Chandler) This is what happens when you dont register for
gifts!"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, We cant accept this.
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Why not?
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Cause its gross.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do
stuff like this at work all the time."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Really?!
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Yeah! I bet I can do it.
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Okay, we owe you a present."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Two! Ive been engaged twice!
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger
boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To
Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, That is the Coast Guard. 
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Were not finished with the
lesson yet."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, All right.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Okay, Im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,
are you ready?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Lets start sailing, and I
want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)
Yo-ho-ho!"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a
little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, lets do that Sailor Joe. Quick
question though, (grabs some of the rigging) whats this called?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Uh, boat rope."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey,"  Uh, rub it?"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Id say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this
one, uh"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Times up, now you're dead."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, And deaf!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not
know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you
sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Yes.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Dont just say yes! This isnt a game, Joey, you can really get
hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, You do?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," You dont? (Laughs) Well, thats the difference between a
professional and a layman."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, That and arrogance.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, (entering) Hey.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Hey! How was sailing?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," I dont want to talk about it. Yknow, you couldve at
least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whats left of the cookie and pops in his
mouth.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of my
grandmothers legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out
to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, (entering with Chandler) Hey.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Hey! How was it?
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We
were bonding. He even said I could call him dad."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, And what did he ask you not to call him?
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Daddy. All right look, heres the story. (Flashback to Chandler
about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished
playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was
really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way
around the steam-filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and
thats when it happened."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Guys?
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
0,season7,703towpc,Mr. Geller," Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door
as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits
next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, I know.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, You gave my father a lap dance!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Why do they put so much steam in there?!
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Come on, its not that big a deal!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to
bond to that part?"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought
this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, I dont want him to tell this story for years.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from
fat camp."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, I wasnt escaping.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, I was trying to help out a squirrel.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, You were trying to eat it!
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," If that is your father calling to tell this story then the
marriage is off!"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)
Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call you
later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," (getting up) All right, Im off to see your dad."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story
anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I
dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. (Exits.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Thank you!
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, (entering) Hey.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Hey.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? "
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Why not?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Because! Youre mean on the boat!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, What? I was just trying to teach you.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!"
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her
dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms
because you were wearing three life jackets."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Look Joey, Im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta
tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all
the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?"""
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Yeah, I didnt want you to get hit by the boom!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldve hurt a lot less if I had
finished that last beer."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," All right, yknow what? I-Im sorry. I will try to tone it
down and uh stop yelling."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, You wont boss me around anymore?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, I wont boss you around.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, And youll be nice?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," And, Ill be nice."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, And youll be topless?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, AndJoey!
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Do you want me to learn?!
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Okay, heres batch 22. Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like
your grandmothers. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Lets give it a shot.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the
ninth grade."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," No, just a Friday night."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross,"  Oh, these are pretty good."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Which one was that?
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a
little bit.) Im okay."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Are there any more from the good batch? Cause we could just work
off of those."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh (Grabs a
cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnt like it.) Its batch 16! 16
people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Okay Joey honey, youre doing really good! All right, now Im
just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which
side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey,  Oh yeah.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Right?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Nope.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Its left sweetie, but thats okay sweetie, thats a
tough one."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, I dont know why you just dont say left.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of
the boat.) The left!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Huh?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youre yelling again! See that?"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Oh, yknow what? Since Im here, I think Im gonna have me
a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Okay Joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the
cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working
efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnt know there."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead
with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not
see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which
obviously is an impossible thing to do!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," All right thats it! Youre yelling and I dont see you
taking your top off! I quit!"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, What do you mean you quit?! You cant quit!
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Why not?!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Because youre not finished yet and I wont have it! Greens do
not quit!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Greens? Im a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Oh my God, wait did II just said Greens dont quit
didnt I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens dont quit?!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Yes! Yes! You did and youre still yelling at me!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," No! No! No! Im not yelling at you, Im just yelling near you.
Oh God Joey, oh Im my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Ive been trying so
hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin. Oh, Joey, Im sorry.
Im so sorry. I just wanted you to learn."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Well, hey I did learn."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Really?
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Yeah! Come on.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Awww
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Yeah, its okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Its
the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is
right."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, Left.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Damnit!
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Yknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to
know that were trying to figure out her recipe. I bet shes l-l-lookin up
at us and smiling right now."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross, Looking up?
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for
sure."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonna
be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck
confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Aww, Pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the
recipe? What about, what about your sister?"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk
to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thats not happening til October 15<sup>th</sup>,
2032."
0,season7,703towpc,Ross," Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got
shuffleboard that day."
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Thats what you think.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers?
Wouldnt they have the recipe?"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My
grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, What was her name?
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe, Nesele Toulouse.
0,season7,703towpc,Monica, <i>Nestle Tollhouse</i>?!
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," (grabbing a bag of <i>Nestle Tollhouse</i> chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this
the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.)
Oh."
0,season7,703towpc,Monica," I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure
out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!"
0,season7,703towpc,Phoebe," I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)
youre burning in hell!!"
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler," So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you
didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a littleIm a
little embarrassed about it."
0,season7,703towpc,Mr. Geller," I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than
embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating
Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I
was a lawyer."
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, What did you do when they found out?
0,season7,703towpc,Mr. Geller," They never did, so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod
along. Shall we? "
0,season7,703towpc,Chandler, So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Yeah, yeah. Hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel,  Oh were not sailing.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Just pull on it.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)
Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whats in the cooler.) Sandwiches!"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, What else?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel, (hands him one) Here you go.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, Thank you.
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel," Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the
stuff falls out.)"
0,season7,703towpc,Joey, What are you doing?
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel,"  Oh, sorry."
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," What youdont hold it like that! Youre lettin all
the good stuff fall out."
0,season7,703towpc,Rachel,  Oh whoops.
0,season7,703towpc,Joey," Careful! Youre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Im my
dad!"
0,season7,704towra,Mac," (on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that
cheerleaders and high explosives dont mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel,
Chandler, and Monica arent amused.)"
0,season7,704towra,C.H.E.E.S.E, You can say that again Mac.
0,season7,704towra,Mac," Well, I couldnt have done it without you buddy. Youre a genius."
0,season7,704towra,C.H.E.E.S.E," Oh yeah? Well then how come I cant get my VCR to stop
blinking 12"
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?"
0,season7,704towra,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom.
(Hands him the phone.)"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
0,season7,704towra,Ross, Ohhhh
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Thats nice.
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a
chance to figure out what theyre gonna say.)"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Well that was ummOkay.
0,season7,704towra,Ross, It wasnt the best.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Well, the lighting was okay."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Ohh no you dont! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!"
0,season7,704towra,Monica, And I have costumes.
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Oh great! That means Im stuck with, ""So, we were watching you
in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin right here! Whoa!"""
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, What are you gonna do Pheebs?
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh
no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, And say nothing?
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah thats right."
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did
you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It
wasnt that good."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, What? You mean behind my back?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," (entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! Youll never
gonna believe what happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and"
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! Youre not
gonna believe what my agent just told me!"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Okay, so anyway Im sittin in my office and guess who walks
in."
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Im gonna be on two TV shows!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Joey!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Oh, you werent finished?"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica
and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my
office!"
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Uh Rach, if youre gonna start another story, at least let me finish
mine."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Its the same story.
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (groans in disgust) Wow, its really long."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that hes so
happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Im so happy for you!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Well, these really are the days of our lives."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, What?!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Well, since you ask. They want me back on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, (gasps) Oh God!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, I gotI get a big pay raise!
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, Oh hey!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Ill be playing Drake Ramorays twin brother, Stryker!"
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Oooh!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, I get to hire my own assistant!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (jumps up) WellI got a head rush from standing up too fast right
there."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
0,season7,704towra,Hilda, Thats right.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last
question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?"
0,season7,704towra,Hilda, What?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Ive never interviewed anyone before. Ive actually never had
anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this
is-this isnt the same thing. "
0,season7,704towra,Hilda, No dear. Its not.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming
in, it was nice to meet you."
0,season7,704towra,Hilda, Thank you! Good meeting you.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, All right. (Hilda exits) Im a total pro!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh Im sorry the models are
actually down the hall."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a
seat there. Umm, so whatswhat iswhats your name?"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Uh-huh, go on."
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Thats it. Thats my whole name.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Thats your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well
lets-lets just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)"
0,season7,704towra,Tag," I know I havent worked in an office before, and I really dont
have a lot of experience, but uh"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Oh come on, what are you talking about? Youve got three years
painting houses. Two whole summers at <i>T.G.I. Fridays</i>, come on!"
0,season7,704towra,Tag," Its lame, I know. But Im a goal-oriented person, very eager to
learn"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and
takes his picture.) Im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it.
Could you just stand up please?"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to
each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
0,season7,704towra,Monica, I cant tell you. Its a secret.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between
one another. We have too much love and respect for one another."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do
not have any secrets from you."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior
year at <i>Disneyland</i>?"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Oh no-no, I cant do that."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Okay.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," So, Ross and I are going to <i>Disneyland</i> and we stop at this
restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of
his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on <i>Space Mountain</i> and
Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Oh my God. He threw up?
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs
hysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?"
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting
fired."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Thats it?! I gave up my <i>Disneyland</i> story for that?
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Thats right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell
her I am sick!"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," No, I-I just dont know how you decide who to hire. I mean
Ive got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot
of experience and then theres this guy"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, What about him?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," I love him. Hes so pretty I wanna cry! I dont know what to
do. Tell me what to do."
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You dont hire
an assistant because theyre cute, you hire them because theyre qualified."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Uh-huh. No, I hear what youre saying and-and-and that makes a lot
of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," Lets see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh But no! No!
You cant-you cant hire him, because thatits not professional. Umm,
this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Okay youre right. Ill hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect
for the job Hilda!"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!
Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!"
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Hey-hey-hey Joey!
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Hey Terry!
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Good to see you again!
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Its been a while, huh? Wow, its funny these halls look smaller
than they used to."
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Its a different building.
0,season7,704towra,Joey, So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Why dont we start right now!
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Okay.
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna
offer me the part."
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Why would you think that?
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Strykers twin brother. I mean, who
looks more me than me right?"
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Everybody has to audition.
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Yknow Terry, I-I dont really need to do this. I got my
own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot."
0,season7,704towra,Terry, Im sorry Joey thatsthats the way it is.
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Well. I guess you think youre pretty special huh? Sittin up
here in your fancy small hall building. Makin stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
Well yknow what? (Throws the script away) This is one star whos hoop
This is a star that the hoopthis hoopI was Dr. Drake Ramoray!"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
0,season7,704towra,Tag," I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face
yesterday. And I noticed there arent any plants in your office so I wanted to bring
you your first (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Kinda.
0,season7,704towra,Tag," Right. So I guess I shouldnt put ""good at noticing stuff"" on my resume.
(Sets the plant down on her desk.)"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Oh-ohh, thank you."
0,season7,704towra,Tag," Anyway, Im guessing you hired somebody."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Well
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, But I hired you!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, What?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Yeah! You-you got the job! Youre my new assistant!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, I am?!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, I cant believe it!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs
and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Hey.
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Hey! Good, youre home!"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Oh its always nicer to hear than, ""Aw crap! You
again!"""
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Hey.
0,season7,704towra,Monica, I made you a surprise.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Oh yeah?
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a
craving for them."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Did you not understand the story?
0,season7,704towra,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Hey! Whats up?
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Ross!
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna do
for dinner."
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Huh.
0,season7,704towra,Ross," (notices the table) HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinner
stuff? You making dinner?"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
0,season7,704towra,Ross, What you got over there? Tacos?
0,season7,704towra,Monica," No! No. Theyre umm Theyre just uhground beef
smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Uhh, those are tacos."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Eh, either way Ill pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still cant
eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
Whats so funny?!"
0,season7,704towra,Monica, (trying not to laugh) Im not laughing. 
0,season7,704towra,Ross, (To Chandler) You told her!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the
shoulder.)"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! Its not like I
chose to do it! Its not likeIts not like I said, ""Umm, what would
make this ride more fun?!"""
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Youre right. I mean Im sorry. Yeah, I shouldnt be
laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler
laughing.)"
0,season7,704towra,Ross, (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," I had to okay?! Were getting married! Married couples
cant keep secrets from one another!"
0,season7,704towra,Ross, Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Du-ude!
0,season7,704towra,Monica, (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Well, Chandler and I are in a bar"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
0,season7,704towra,Ross," And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes
over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what
youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes
out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes
to bars and makes out withgirls."
0,season7,704towra,Monica, (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Was she happy you gave her the job?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant."
0,season7,704towra,Joey," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To
Phoebe and Rachel) Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me
for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next
weeks script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like theyre taking it off the
air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) Were not even
shootin them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E!"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, Sorry.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Im sorry Joey.
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg
warmers!"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest
and won!"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Ross came in fourth and cried!
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Oh my God! (Laughing)
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler
should know some of your secrets too!"
0,season7,704towra,Monica, I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni
off a jewelry box shed made."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch <i>Golden
Girls</i>!"
0,season7,704towra,Ross, Monica couldnt tell time til she was 13!
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Its hard for some people!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Hey!!!
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Ohh, Im sorry I couldnt think of any more for Ross!"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who
cleaned our dorm!"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, That was you!
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
0,season7,704towra,Joey," How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today,
I got nothin!"
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Well wait a minute, what happened to <i>Days of Our Lives</i>?"
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, What happened?
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Joey, why would you do that?"
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Because they wanted me to audition!
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, You! An actor?! Thats madness!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Rachel Greens office. (Hangs up.)
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?"
0,season7,704towra,Tag, (shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Really? (Giggles.)
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Hi! Rachel Greens office.
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, You must be Hilda.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a
second? (Goes into office.)"
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Phoebe! Thats a great name.
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe," Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. Well be right back. (They go into her
office and she closes the door.)"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but Im telling
you"
0,season7,704towra,Phoebe, But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably
not the smartest thing that Ive ever done. But Im telling you, from this
moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (Theres a knock on the door.) Yes? "
0,season7,704towra,Kathy, Hey Rachel!
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,704towra,Kathy, Cute assistant! Whats his story? Is he
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
0,season7,704towra,Joey, Hey! Terry.
0,season7,704towra,Terry," Joey Tribbiani! Im surprised your big head could fit through our
small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey."
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Wait! Terry! WaitLookWait I-I Look, Im really
sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking Im too big to audition for you. You
gotta give me another chance."
0,season7,704towra,Terry, I cant help you Joey.
0,season7,704towra,Joey," Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no
idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake."
0,season7,704towra,Nurse #1," This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its
hopeless."
0,season7,704towra,Nurse #2," Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker.
Look, here he comes."
0,season7,704towra,Dr. Stryker Ramoray," Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and
whispers to him.) Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?"
0,season7,704towra,Joey, (jumping up and removing the bandages) Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Yknow, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
very little glue."
0,season7,704towra,Ross," And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
0,season7,704towra,Monica, No!
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
0,season7,704towra,Monica," I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are
you laughing at <i>Pampers</i>? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Yknow when I said that because were getting married that
we should share everything and not have any secrets? "
0,season7,704towra,Monica, Yeah?
0,season7,704towra,Chandler, Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that.
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Ohh, absolutely."
0,season7,704towra,Ross," And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from
everybody else."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Yeah, definitely!"
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Okay, (gets up) if youll excuse me, I-Im gonna go hang out
with some people who dont know the <i>Space Mountain</i> story."
0,season7,704towra,Monica," Then, Id steer clear of Phoebe."
0,season7,704towra,Ross," Man! (Monica mouths, ""Im sorry."")"
0,season7,704towra,Chandler," Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnt hang out
withall the guys in my office."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Do you have a minute?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Well yeah, sure, whats up?"
0,season7,704towra,Tag, I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Oh really?!
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
0,season7,704towra,Tag," But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I
was gay."
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Whys that?
0,season7,704towra,Tag, I dont think I should say.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you
cant tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)"
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Okay.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Kay.
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Well
0,season7,704towra,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,704towra,Tag, Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
0,season7,704towra,Rachel," (Pause) Yeah, shes gay."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Hey.
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Whats the matter?
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Oh Willies still alive!
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, What are you guys doing?
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in
the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos
going like this (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,
this shall be known as The Face.)"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the <i>Statue
of Liberty</i>."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," (looking at one) Oh, heres a great one."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Yeah, Im not in that."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," I know, but look at me"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional
photographer."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines!
Yknow (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so
stupid."
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Chandler what do you say?
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
(Does The Face while saying that last part.)"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, How about those three-pointers?
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Amazing!
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," And those guys were this (Doing the standard ""This
Close"" gesture) close to lettin us play this time too."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Hey look-look, Phoebes talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He
Pees."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Hey, I thought that guy was married."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, He is! But hes getting divorcedRoss! Maybe you know him.
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Its not a club.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Phoebe, if this guys going through a divorce, is it such a good
idea to start going out with him?"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Hey, divorced men are not bad men!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, They have that on the napkins at the club.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh, I gotta get back to work."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, You dont have to be back for a half-hour!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!
I could just spread him on a cracker."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean
yknow you cant date him right?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend
so much time together he should call me his work wife."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Soon hell be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," I am not gonna get fired, because Im not gonna act on it."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, So you wouldnt mind if he was dating someone else?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Why? Is he? He is! Isnt he? Hes dating that slut in
marketing!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Dude that is so sad.
0,season7,705towep,Ross, I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Could I play?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag, I just did them.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh, well drop and give me ten more!"
0,season7,705towep,Tag, What?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Yeah, I filled them out last night?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?"
0,season7,705towep,Melissa, Hey Rachel!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, whats up? Im just uh, about
to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Yknow, like
dried fruit and granola and stuff. Whats up? (She has put on the backpack.)"
0,season7,705towep,Melissa," Umm, is Tag here?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, No. Why?
0,season7,705towep,Melissa," Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
0,season7,705towep,Melissa," Well, weve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that
tonight it would turn into something a little more than that."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This aint a locker room, okay?
But, yknow I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight."
0,season7,705towep,Melissa, Oh no!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh yeah. All right, back to work."
0,season7,705towep,Melissa, Hey! Isnt that Tags backpack.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Yeah Melissa, I dont want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but
I will call your supervisor."
0,season7,705towep,The Photographer," (taking pictures) Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now,
Chandler, you want to give us a smile?"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Okay. (Does The Face.)
0,season7,705towep,The Photographer," Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," No, I am."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a
beautiful smile."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)"
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All
right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try
umm, try looking sexy."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Okay. (Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face he
makes, but it isnt good.)"
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Or not.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Uhh, well Ive got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce
all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got
an extra one?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Yeah, sure. Ummhere. (Hands him one.)"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Great. (He doesnt like it.) You got anything thats not <i>Ralph
Lauren</i>?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Yeah, I dont think so Joe."
0,season7,705towep,Joey," All right, I guess this will be fine."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Nothing, why?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go
out on a date with a dude."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Im not asking you to go on a date with him!
0,season7,705towep,Joey, Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Joey, just-just he-hes new in town and I know he doesnt have
any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. Ill really
appreciate it."
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Yeah, okay."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) OohHey, donuts!"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all
over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)"
0,season7,705towep,Monica," I know. Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. Okay,
well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the
days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your
face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,""
not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!
Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Aww! (Smiles.)
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
0,season7,705towep,Ross," I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, ""I love you and
thats why I have to kill you."""
0,season7,705towep,Monica," They cant all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Do you really want to pull at that thread?
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Im having a really good time!
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your
neck."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend."
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have
these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so
Id just be lost."
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from
my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Okay, dont freak out. Ill go."
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I
cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah, umm thats Whitney (Points), Kyles ex-wife out there,
now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, What?! No!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She
holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Look, I dont think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, Ill do it.
But just because youre a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Hi Ginger.
0,season7,705towep,Ross, All right! I want my key back!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, I dont have it!
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Its right there! (Points to her hand.)
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Look, Im sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though, for diverting
Kyles ex. "
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Oh yeahNoYoure welcome. Well talk about it later.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Hi Whitney.
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," (To Ross) Kyles ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date
her!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! Im sorry, but can you give me a
second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night?"
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, Sure.
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended
up having a great time! Okay?"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Watching ballroom dancing?
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Yes! Thats where we realized we were both super cool people!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad
stuff about her."
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Like what?
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Like shes really mean, and shes over critical,
and-andNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking
with you!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Okay.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, And! She uses sex as a weapon!
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Ill be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Youre still gonna go out with her?!
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Yeah!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Well, didnt you just hear what I said?!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her
ex-husbands gonna say that stuff. Now, if youll excuse me"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
0,season7,705towep,Whitney," (outside the door) Uh, your door isnt sound proof."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Good morning.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Ohh thats nice.
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! 
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Wo-women? You mean like old women?
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Well kinda old, like 30."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, (Pause) Oh.
0,season7,705towep,Tag," And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like
20 phone numbers last night."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some
stuff huh?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag, A little.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,705towep,Tag," (To her, in the Joey voice) How you doin?"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a
camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) Youre changing it!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, I cant help it!
0,season7,705towep,Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when
I take resume shots?"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Borrow money from me?
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I
look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and
smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), youre looking
down, keep looking down"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Why is there jelly on your shoe?
0,season7,705towep,Joey, I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
0,season7,705towep,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night."
0,season7,705towep,Joey, Yeah! That guys alright!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
0,season7,705towep,Joey, What?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Yknow, all the women."
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow,
thats why I never had any luck with Chandler."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, (Pause) Im right here!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,
just the idea of you and he and all these women, its justAnd I know hes
my assistant and I cant date himbut it just bothers me, all right?!"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great
partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Im still right here!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and
unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!"
0,season7,705towep,Joey, (shocked) What?!
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," I just dont want him to meet anybody until I am over my
crushAnd I will get over it. Its-its not like I love him, its just
physical! ButI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush
on you when I first met ya!"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," I know, Monica told me."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their
attention.)"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?"
0,season7,705towep,Joey, I dont know Rach.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free <i>Ralph Lauren</i> shirts."
0,season7,705towep,Joey, One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel."
0,season7,705towep,Joey, Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Really?
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Yeah, for you!"
0,season7,705towep,Monica, (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, There I am!
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Are you okay?
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an
antihistamine."
0,season7,705towep,Monica, What?!
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to
Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Chandler, what were you thinking?"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I
know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look
down, look down (He falls asleep.)"
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Chandler?
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Hi.
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Hi.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand F.Y.I
she mustve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his
response to each one was, ""I dont give a tiny rats ass."""
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah well, maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decorating
and a little more time in the bedroom."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Well, I dont think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe
thats just because I am not emotionally unavailable!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, You think hes emotionally unavailable?
0,season7,705towep,Ross, I think he can be.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Well, maybe he wouldnt be if she didnt bring the office home
every night!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Years Eve
1997."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That
was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
0,season7,705towep,Ross," So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)
Im sorry you had to see that."
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Good morning Rachel.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Hi! (He hands her her mail) Thanks, hey so uh whatd you do last
night?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Went out with Joey.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Oh yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chickas?
0,season7,705towep,Tag," No. We had a really good talk. I dont think Im gonna do that
bar scene anymore."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Wow! I did not see that coming.
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Its just not really who I am. Y'know, Ive always been happier
whenWhy am I telling you this? You dont care about this stuff."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying
I am happier when uh, yknow?"
0,season7,705towep,Tag," When Im in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Really?
0,season7,705towep,Tag," Someone I can spoil, yknow?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Sp-spoil?
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," Well, I-Im startin too."
0,season7,705towep,Tag," And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about
it right?"
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Yes! Hell yes!
0,season7,705towep,Tag," All right then, its settled."
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,705towep,Tag, Im gettin back together with my ex-girlfriend.
0,season7,705towep,Rachel, Id love to!
0,season7,705towep,Tag, What?
0,season7,705towep,Rachel," (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)
Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and
she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, My God!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Oh, Im sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish
in bed, hows Whitney?"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Well maybe she wouldnt have to be selfish in bed if someone else
knew where everything was!"
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," Oh hey! Good, youre both here."
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, We kinda need to talk.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, Both of you together?
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Wh-whats up?
0,season7,705towep,Whitney," Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and
we got to reminiscing"
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason
we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
(Pause)"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Oh just say it Kyle!
0,season7,705towep,Kyle, Were gonna give it another try.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe, What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, Im gonna work on that.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Oh right, because youre so capable of change."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," (To Whitney) Yknow, he hums when he pees!"
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, I do know.
0,season7,705towep,Ross," It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
0,season7,705towep,Whitney, Were so sorry. (They get up to leave.)
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im
over it already."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass."
0,season7,705towep,Kyle," Yeah, were gonna go. (They leave.)"
0,season7,705towep,Ross," (To Phoebe) Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about
her. Yknow, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a
little."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to."
0,season7,705towep,Ross," Yeah, we're better off without them."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let
him in your sad mens club!"
0,season7,705towep,Ross, Divorced mens club.
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Potato, Potaato. (Shes pronounces potato with the both the short
and long As.)"
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," Ooh, lets see it!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Ahhh.
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
0,season7,705towep,Chandler," Oh yeah, that looks good."
0,season7,705towep,Phoebe," You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a
shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)"
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Yeah, we look great together."
0,season7,705towep,Monica," Yeah, we really do!"
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,705towep,Monica, Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
0,season7,705towep,Joey," Yknow, we dont have to imagine."
0,season7,705towep,Chandler, Im marrying her.
0,season7,705towep,Joey, Well just see.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I
have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really
hope its you!"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, I hope its you.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Me too!
0,season7,706my100,Monica," First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so
important to me"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where
we trade off being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were
mine"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Yes!!! Oh!!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Hypothetically!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Still.
0,season7,706my100,Monica, If Phoebe were my maid of honor
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Uh-hmm.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all
get to do it once and no one would get upset."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," (laughs) Well thats the best part. Umm, you guys get to
decide!"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Wh-why is that the best part?
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Because then I dont have to!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we
can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A
woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlers name and starts listening
closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that"
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Im really not deciding!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Fine!
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Yeah thats right.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, <i>Die Hard</i> still great!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Whatd you rent?
0,season7,706my100,Joey, <i>Die Hard 2</i>.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," (looking at the tape) Joey, this is <i>Die Hard </i>1 again."
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Oh, well we watch it a second time and its <i>Die Hard 2</i>!"
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Joey, we just saw it!"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, And?
0,season7,706my100,Ross, And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Dude, you didnt say <i>Die Hard</i>. Is everything okay?"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Well, John McClane had plans!"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all
worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
0,season7,706my100,Joey, What are you talking about? Bitch.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Hey Rachel?
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Really?!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Im justWait a minute. If Im
your maid of honor that means you are Monicas."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Oh! Well, if thats what you want"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicas!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, But why does it even matter?!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Why does it matter so much to you?!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Because this one is now! And-and its two of our best
friends! Who knows what youre gonna marry!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, What-what if I marry RossOr Joey?
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," (gasps) You wouldnt! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to
do this, but I-Ive never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know youve
done it at least twice!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Yeah but Phoebe
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I
guess that was it."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Itssince youve never done it before you
can be Monicas maid of honor."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Im gonna marry someone good yknow.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Oh I know.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, ""Like what
isnt?"")"
0,season7,706my100,Ross, What happened?!!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Well, I dont know!!"
0,season7,706my100,Ross, We fell asleep! That is all.
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go."
0,season7,706my100,Ross, I think that would be best.
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later."
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Okay. But not about this!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rosss hand.) Bye."
0,season7,706my100,Ross, No touch! No touch!
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman
overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Thats sweet.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," No, its more like a (sarcastically) good luck."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," So uh, what did this woman look like?"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing
called a mirror?"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not
attractive (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He
gets up and grabs a photo album."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, What are you doing?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Well, lets see (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is
that her? (Pointing to the picture.)"
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Oh my God yes! Who is she?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Did you break up with her?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," (pause) No, were still together. Yeah we went out for two
summers, and then I broke up with her."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Why?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten
really fa-aa-aw-ow"
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Fat?!
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow"""
0,season7,706my100,Monica, You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still
feel bad?"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Well, apparently she does."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not
amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me."
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Hey! Whats going on?
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Phoebe is gonna be Monicas maid of honor!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that
girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, See? This is exactly why you shouldnt lie!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, All right thats it! I am maid of honor!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Na-uh, I am!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, How come you are?!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Because I cared enough to lie!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could
have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type
situations."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, What are you talking about?
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Im the best of
the people they see, they give me the part."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Well, its better than us deciding."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Oh, come on! This is crazy! Cant we just flip a coin?!"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, No! Coins hate me!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Okay. Okay fine, yknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)"
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as <i>Georgio</i>. "
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Hi.
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Just uh, brought back your videos."
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
0,season7,706my100,Ross, No! No we dont!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! "
0,season7,706my100,Ross, I I dont know what you are talking about.
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Ive had better.
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Okay! When?!
0,season7,706my100,Ross, All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Uh-huh!
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Ive said it! Okay?! But its over Joey!
0,season7,706my100,Joey, I want to do it again.
0,season7,706my100,Ross, We cant do it again.
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Why not?
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Because its weird!
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Fine! Do you want something to drink?
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Sure, what do you got?"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Warm milk and <i>Excedrin P.M.</i> (Ross just leaves.)
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you
are!"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Can you figure out what Im doing?
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Youre Lewis Posin.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Who?
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day
I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the
bathroom?!"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa. (Chandler emerges,
without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as
I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis
apologized to me."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better
person and that is not the man you fell in love with!"
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Okay, all right, this is how its going to work. Were gonna
give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 being the highest."
0,season7,706my100,Ross," No, 10 is the highest."
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Why is 10 the highest?
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Because its the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel
youre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, (crying) I dont want to marry Chandler!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Okay, uh"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Ive got cold feet.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, its gonna be okay!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," No, one man for the rest of my life? I dont know if I can do it!
This means Ill never get to sleep with Joey!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yknow,
its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember
that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You dont get to keep the
gifts."
0,season7,706my100,Joey," (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I
like that!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Thanks!
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Yes, very nice Rachel."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Thank you judges.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Ugh, what a kiss ass."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Oh!
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Okay, Phoebe"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Yes! Your honor?
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Were now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do""
when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
0,season7,706my100,Ross," (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember
that(Phoebe screams and tackles him)Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Oh!
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!"
0,season7,706my100,Ross, It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Ohh, wait a minute, we havent pre"
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Go!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Okay! Okay! Umm, <i>Websters Dictionary</i> defines marriage
as (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!
Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a
couple of six-year-olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he
seemed like a six-year-old."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Ive known them separately and
Ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are
truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds
it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon
together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Yeah, it really was!"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Aw, thanks!"
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Okay Phoebe, I guess youre next (To Joey) although I really
dont see the point."
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Yeah.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Okay, I cant believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this today with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
(Raises her glass and drinks.)"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, And shes back in the game.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember
me."
0,season7,706my100,Julie, Hello Skidmark.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," (To Monica) Its a nickname, Ill explain later."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Its pretty clear.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken
up with you because you were overweight."
0,season7,706my100,Julie, Thats why you broke up with me?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," You-you-you didnt know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I
guess my work here is done!"
0,season7,706my100,Joey," All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed
very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that
in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelDamnit!"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Really?! I won!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Im sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Ive heard that
before.)"
0,season7,706my100,Ross," Actually, it wasnt that close."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," No! Yknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was
ridiculousWere gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the
coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, The coins have finally forgiven me!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Well yknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw
her
her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," (running after her) Rach, its gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)
You guys are the best!"
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,706my100,Joey," Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on
my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) "
0,season7,706my100,Ross, Why-why would I care about that?
0,season7,706my100,Joey," No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill
be. "
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im
going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt
have to apologize."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, I would really love it if I could do both.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," All right, II have to ask."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, What?
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, What?!
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have
gained?"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, A hundred and forty-five pounds.
0,season7,706my100,Monica," In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not
the point."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I
was 15!"
0,season7,706my100,Monica," Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember
when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, How?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
0,season7,706my100,Monica," What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different.
Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!"
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin,
beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize
for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. "
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Keep going.
0,season7,706my100,Chandler," So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love
you."
0,season7,706my100,Monica, Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Id carry you around in my pocket.
0,season7,706my100,Monica, I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
0,season7,706my100,Chandler, Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Hi Pheebs.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Hi! I just want to apologize. Im really sorry I was a baby.
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Thats ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at
her.) Oh, you mean today."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yknow
I was thinking about it, if-if youre Monicas maid of honor that means I get to
be yours."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Oh yeah!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started
putting some stuff together, yknow just in case"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Oh thats so sweet thanks.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this
is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows
Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was <i>Wonder
Woman</i>. Oh and heres a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)
Yknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Ohh.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause, people cry at
weddings. (Starting to cry.) Im just gonna grab a couple of these."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, This stuff is great!
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was
saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicas something borrowed and its
blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah"
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Yknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicas
maid
of honor."
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, You do? Why?
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, Because I think it means more to you.
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," But Pheebs, yknow you earned it."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe,"  It's fine. I mean, this is something that youve been thinking about
since you were what, 14? (Shes referring to the Halloween picture.)"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," No, I was ten. I just developed early."
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe, (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
0,season7,706my100,Monica," (entering) Hey, whats going on?"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,706my100,Phoebe," Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
0,season7,706my100,Monica," (gasps) Ohh, wow! Thats great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We
really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should
probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; well
get together before work! What do you say, 6"
0,season7,706my100,Rachel," Yeah okay, you laugh now, but shes gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets
suddenly scared.)"
0,season7,706my100,Joey, Great nap.
0,season7,706my100,Ross, It really was.
0,season7,706my100,Joey," (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)"
0,season7,706my100,Ross, (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Morning!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Pretty good.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; Im late for work."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, What-what?! Youre gonna leave this person with me?!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," YeahHey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Im
not looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
Im a lonerNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up with
the likes of me."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yknow what? Thats a lot to remember, cant I just tell
her youre a pig?"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Hey, Im gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! Hed even make the girl pancakes! Plus, hed make extras and leave
em for me."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Well forget it, Im not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Fine! (Pause) Now, whered we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Hi.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Hi.
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," Hi. I dont mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me?"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Come on! Why are we here?!
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Okay, okay take a guess."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, The hot chicks?
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
yknow-yknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! Its here! Yeah, its right-its right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Wow thats actually pretty cool.
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," (stopping quickly) Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
0,season7,707towrb,Female Student, (as they are moving past Ross) Im so sorry!
0,season7,707towrb,Male Student, Sorry!
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," You didnt bring  me here to do that, did you?"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, She sent the chicken back again?!
0,season7,707towrb,The Waitress," She says its too dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you exactly how she wants it."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planets most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. Shes the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice."
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Im fine.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," (notices Monicas engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! Im blind!"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Oh Uh
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," So, whos the lucky guy?"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," OHMYGAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Well, she saw the ring."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Did she freak out?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Right.
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," (laughs) You said no, right?"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Huh?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," You said no, right?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I cant wait to read your book, Ross!!"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," What do you think, shes just gonna sit there quietly? You
dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing <i>Part-time Lover</i>?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either, is
she?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what?
Shes probably not gonna even want to come."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Really?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, So-so you wouldve just lied?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Yes!!
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Would it really have been that easy?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Yes!!!
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Good, so do it Saturday night because were going to dinner with
her and Clark."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Hey! Whats up?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Hey-hey, whos your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!"
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Hey Joey!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Erin! Still here!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, I know!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Okay!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Yeah. Ill uh, Ill call ya."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Oh and Ill call ya too!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Or Ill call you!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, And call me!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again."
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Bye.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Bye-bye.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Bye!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," So, system kinda broke down huh?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Oh Joey, Im sorry I just couldnt tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And yknow we got to talking and I"
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, We want you to marry her!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, What?!!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, She is so amazing! You have no idea.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Cupid.
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Joey, shes so cool. She speaks four languages."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Man, do you know what guys want!"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Look Joey, come on, shes so perfect for you! I mean, shes
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," My beers?! Look you guys, shes a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I justI dont see it going anywhere."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Yeah, but you always say that."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Look, Im sorry you guys, I-I just dont think so."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Whatever.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Fine. (They start to walk away.)
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Hey, dont start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? Youre the one
whos in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, youre the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Phoebe!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Secret affair!
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, People are doing it in front of my book!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Im sorry?
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah, there was. It wasthere the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever readYes, there was."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Great! Because people kept showing up, I think its like uh-a thing!"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, Oh for cryin out loud! (He storms out.)
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," All right, so we should go catch our movie."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Well now whats the rush?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Well look whos here!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Joey.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Erin.
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Hey Rachel.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!"
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Whats wrong?
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Oh no.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, (skeptical) What party?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Whos birthday party?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," (still skeptical) Oh, and how old is Alison?"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why dont you guys do
something?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Excuse me. Hi, Im a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
0,season7,707towrb,The Librarian," Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)"
0,season7,707towrb,The Head Librarian, How can I help you?
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
0,season7,707towrb,The Head Librarian," We are aware of the problem you are referring to. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I cant help you."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Well, fine. Fine! If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And dont you follow me!"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, How did it go with Erin?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Yknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Didnt you sleep together?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Yeah, that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if
we were ever
to have kids, well thats a"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please dont get married before I do."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Okay.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, He might still show up.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Is that all?
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you
tell about your lovely wedding?"
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure
why were having it."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Its actually going to be just family.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing <i>Careless Whisper</i> or <i>Lady In
Red</i>?"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, How can you say that?! The <i>Mets </i>have no closer!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, What about Benitez?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, What about Game 1 of the Series?
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, What about shut up?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
Ill be right back. "
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, So hows it goin with Joey?
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," Uh, okay."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him."
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," Look, hes a really great guy and I know that you really want
this to work out, but I just dont see this having a future."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!"
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Kinda.
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Then change it back!
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Im sorry I Its just theres no real spark.
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, No spark? Didnt you sleep together?
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Yeah.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Ugh, tramp!"
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Does Joey have any idea?
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," I really dont think he does. And yknow what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Yknow, tell him Im-Im not interested in a
serious relationship or something."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Yeah, you mean like that youre kind of a loner."
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Yeah! That would be great!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Yeah, and maybe that youre a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesnt matter what she said. Its not important so I dont need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Im sorry?
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Oh well, I guess Italian isnt one of the four languages you speak."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
0,season7,707towrb,Erin," Yeah, lets go."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Okay. See you guys later.
0,season7,707towrb,Erin, Bye guys.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah, see ya."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
0,season7,707towrb,Guy," Yeah, we werewe were just looking around."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
0,season7,707towrb,Guy, Uhh.
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Ah AhGet out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views
on evolution?"
0,season7,707towrb,Woman," Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, I find Marions views far too progressionist.
0,season7,707towrb,Woman," Im sorry, who are you?"
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Im a professor here uh, RossGeller."
0,season7,707towrb,Woman," Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?"
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
0,season7,707towrb,Woman," Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought.
Youreyoure so young."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
0,season7,707towrb,Ross, I am veryvery sorry.
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," So how was, how was your date?"
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, Im
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe, Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," No-no-no-no-no! Its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky
though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Where are you gettin this?
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Well, she told me. She said shes kind of a loner."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Oh. Oh.
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Joey
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," No hey Rach, its cool okay? Yknow Im a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?"
0,season7,707towrb,Phoebe," Hey Joey, yknow what? You are way too good for her."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel," Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell em youre not looking for a relationship."
0,season7,707towrb,Joey," No! No. Dont do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, Yeah?
0,season7,707towrb,Rachel, Do you want some pancakes?
0,season7,707towrb,Joey, (coming back out) Finally!
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, What are we gonna do?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, I say we go with <i>Careless Whisper</i>.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, Chandler?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldnt really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I
might do."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Well justwell just let her stay.
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Kinda like your barcalounger.
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Is that what youre thinking about right now?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, I never stop thinking about it.
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight."
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, Why not?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Okay, Im going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? Cause its already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, Why?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica, Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
0,season7,707towrb,Janice, He does?
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, Say again?
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding."
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler," Feelings, such strong feelings."
0,season7,707towrb,Monica," I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can."
0,season7,707towrb,Janice," Ohmy Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Ill go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)"
0,season7,707towrb,Ross," (to the guard) Dont sweat it, Ive got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
peoples eye(The guard walks away)Okay, see you later. "
0,season7,707towrb,Chandler, I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," No, no, no. No-no-no. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all
the states in six minutes. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, What? That's like insanely easy! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least
one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so
technically I didn't lose. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, What? You forgot fourteen states? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thats true in so many ways, trust
me, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)"
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Oh, okay, time's up! "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," All right, I got 48. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of
celery, and I have one"
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables,
Joey? "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Wow, how many have you got? "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Fifty-six! 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports
team! "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)
There you go. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, 'Cause you invited your assistant. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato
stuffed pumpkin. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so
delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but
I still do."
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have
that. (She gets up and heads for her room) "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Done! With time-a to spare. 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up
Ross' pad) "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a
group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,
or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, What? That's impossible. 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,
watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up! "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," No, just give me another minute. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,
okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50
before dinner. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Okay, but if you can'tno dinner! "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, You're on! 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on
there that you don't have. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know that your oven
doesn't work? "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Pshhshhh!
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket) 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe
in your apartment. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Phoebe, why is your bag moving? "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Oh, it's not! "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Seriously, it's moving! "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, What the hell is in there? 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's
bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more
often? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like
old pumpkins or something. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, That's my pie! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Which smells delicious! 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, What? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks
out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," I'm sorry, who's this? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," No, there's no dog here? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicas
apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, I'll be right there! 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're
here already? How are they doing this? "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still
good. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your
girlfriend? "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, We kinda broke up this morning. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," Yeah, so she went back to Ohio."
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Ohio!! Thank you! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Huh! Where is the dog?!
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Yeah that dog left! 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, There's no dog in here. 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the
dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I
have a dog in my room. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, What is it doing here? 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She
bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?"
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5
minutes, my throat will just close up! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, (gasping) Really? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a
reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Well, it still has to go, right?"
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Okay, it's um"
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, (interrupting him) Don't do it! 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Don't do what? 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,
""Do what you have to do"") Okay, I hate dogs. "
0,season7,708cdld,All, What? 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Are you crazy? 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Are you out of your mind?
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Why? 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are
thinking, and that scares me a little bit. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat
out of my hand!!!"
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, (scared) Is there a puppy here? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, You don't like puppies? 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," (to Tag) Okay, you are new!"
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's
like Ross not likin ice cream. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, You don't like ice cream? 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, It's too cold. 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I
don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An
awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
"
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, 1250.
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Damn, I forgot you were here. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We'll be back in a
minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Yeah. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move? "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Oh, I'd say about a month. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Interesting. 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," When it's your assistant, I would say never. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because
if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Huh. A moo-point? 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did
that all just make sense?"
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hes
obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is
this pretty, no one cares what's inside. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Hey! 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Hey. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, How are you holding up? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Not bad. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Thanks. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, So were you guys together a long time? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Now that she broke up with you? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Yeah. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Yeah. Hmmmm. 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in
love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do
you ever have that feeling? "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," NoYeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know
that I figure itit has to work out. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Why? 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Because, uhit has to. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," You have all the answers, don't you? "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," Hey, thanks for talking to me. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you
should go for it! "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, What? 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel
moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed) "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, What did Joey say? I like you back? 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Uh, yeah, well, see, he Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure
about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,
yeah!"
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what
he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.) 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's
crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I
want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be
really great if you said something right about now. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He
points down to the street) "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, What? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!! 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you
wanna get off your chest? "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, I can't believe this! (He walks back in again) 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and
theyre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh
look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in too) "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Yeah, okay. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to
Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her! "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't
even know. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, That's not gonna work. 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's
not so smart. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica, Hey! I didn't know either. 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Yeah, I knew. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Where's Chandler? 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, Wash your hands!!!
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, How did youknow? (Heads back into the bathroom) 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Hey! What's she doing back here? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.
Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Yeah, but, but look what I'm... "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her
room) "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Why not? 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Well, I, I should go in there. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Why not? 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Because you sent away the dog!
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog
named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her
friendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.
Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that
Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,
w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Ross, you need some help? "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)
Yes, please! "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make
stuff up!"
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I
have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I
freaked him out "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," No, no he went for a walk. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back! "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, (gasps) Hi! 
0,season7,708cdld,Joey," Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
"
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! "
0,season7,708cdld,Joey, You think? 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," Hi, honey. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. "
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," What? Why, why would... "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we
won't. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.
Yknow, for you, and(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have
gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,
which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,
so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then
over to the street) "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," We have good news, look who's back! "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, (uncovers the dog) Hi! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
0,season7,708cdld,Monica," That's right, she came back all by herself. "
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe, It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you! 
0,season7,708cdld,Phoebe," Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she
must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with
her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in(Realizes, that Chandler starts to
not believe her) I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell
you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able
to eat something. "
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, It's up to you. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Oh, hi! How are you doing? "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Oh. 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," Thanks for having me over, you guys. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get
the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Colorado. 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross," Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag, Okay. 
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Ityknow what? It
just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever
happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never
talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," Um, I'm not. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out. "
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that
nothing could ever happen between us. "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel, Really? 
0,season7,708cdld,Tag," Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her) "
0,season7,708cdld,Rachel," Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, All right. 
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler," You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross gets the turkey out
of the fridge and starts to unwrap it) You got Nevada twice. "
0,season7,708cdld,Ross, (pauses) I know. 
0,season7,708cdld,Chandler, Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
0,season7,709candy,Ben, (on the bike) Im ready!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, You sure?
0,season7,709candy,Ben, Uh-huh!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)"
0,season7,709candy,Ben, (To Chandler) Thanks daddy.
0,season7,709candy,Ross," No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours.
(Ross pushes him off.)"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Okay. Okay.
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," His first big kids bike, this is so exciting!"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me
to the park, I got it, andit bent."
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Yeah.
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, I never had a bike of my own.
0,season7,709candy,Ross, (shocked) What?!
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street
had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the
handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those
plastic daisies stuck on."
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My
dad gave me his old one."
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Ohh.
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Did the girl ever let you ride it?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the
bike on the front. (Theyre all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad
would drag me around the backyard."
0,season7,709candy,Ross, That is so unfair!
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,
""Oh."")"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Hey! What are you guys doing? 
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Im sorry, who?"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Im gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)
on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece."
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, But we dont know the neighbors.
0,season7,709candy,Joey," I do. Theres uh, lets see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot
Lady, Some Kids Ive Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn
their names and get to know our neighbors."
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Eh, somebodys in a good mood!"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Well, why shouldnt I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful
job!"
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Where you can make out with your assistant.
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Come on, its not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with
a plan so that us dating will not be a problem."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Oh yeah, whats the plan?"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We We are not
going to let it be a problem."
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Well yknow, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to
giggle.)"
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Did you two
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Oh Monica come on, yknow I dont sleep with guys on the first
date!"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Anymore!!
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Okay.
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?"
0,season7,709candy,Tag," Yes, at 4"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Okay, thank you. Thatll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag
starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes
the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on
between us. (They kiss.)"
0,season7,709candy,Tag, Id better get back to my desk.
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your
evaluation."
0,season7,709candy,Tag, My what?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation. But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet
to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.) "
0,season7,709candy,Tag, Are you serious?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this
up?"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Well, either that or uh(Motions towards Joeys door.)"
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Joey!! 
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Yeah?
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
0,season7,709candy,Joey," Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was
only a couple of pieces left!"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! (Starts to
do so.)"
0,season7,709candy,Joey," Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something
mightve happened to a huge chunk of it."
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a crime wave!! (Monica runs
to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Sure!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I
couldnt stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike,
so "
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, You like it?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, I love it!!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Ahh.
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, yknow give it
a test ride."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present Ive
ever gotten."
0,season7,709candy,Ross, (stunned at the compliment) Youre welcome.
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandlers about to cry."
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, (about to cry) Am not!
0,season7,709candy,Monica, (turning a light on) Who is that?!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (They
get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the
door.) Can you tell me who is there please?"
0,season7,709candy,Gary, Hi!
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Hi. Do you know what time it is?
0,season7,709candy,Gary," Its candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops
of heaven."
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, (laughs) 4
0,season7,709candy,Gary," So, can I get some candy?"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!
(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the
morning."
0,season7,709candy,Gary," Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building? "
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Um-hmm.
0,season7,709candy,Gary, (looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
0,season7,709candy,Tag," No! It was marked confidential, I just sent it down to Human Resources."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," (worried) Okay please, youre kidding right?! I wrote that one as a
joke for you!"
0,season7,709candy,Tag, A joke they would appreciate?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Im thinkin no.
0,season7,709candy,Tag, What did you say?!
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like
your tiney-tiny tushie."
0,season7,709candy,Tag," No, not my tushie."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,
""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems
with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a
little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the
story, I almost cried."
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about <i>Titanic</i>!"
0,season7,709candy,Joey, (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Oh yeah! I saw her walkin it down the street the other day. She
had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute."
0,season7,709candy,Joey," Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin it by the park."
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?"
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Hey Pheebs?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Oh hi!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Ohh, uh-huh so much!"
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Pheebs you uhyou do know how to ride a bike dont you?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Of course!
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Umm, can we see you ride it?"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,
gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And
there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you
hear that Chandler? No such thing!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, (with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they
didnt take it the way I meant it."
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Absolutely! Yknow, because tushie can mean both ass and good
worker."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!"
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Hey Rach?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,709candy,Joey," That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like
this? (He shows her what hes been drawing.)"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Oh my God! Joey!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, What is the matter with you?
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Ugh!
0,season7,709candy,Joey," Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford
porn."
0,season7,709candy,The Woman," Hi! Im sorry, I know its after hours but I really need
candy."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Im sorry, I cant help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)
Rules are rules."
0,season7,709candy,The Woman," Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them
all about your candy!"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell em?"
0,season7,709candy,The Woman, I told em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, but
whatever."
0,season7,709candy,The Woman," Please, cant you help me out?"
0,season7,709candy,Joey," (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really
loud?"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," (still talking to the woman) All right, Ill do it just this once!
But you cant tell anybody!"
0,season7,709candy,The Woman," (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!"
0,season7,709candy,The Woman, (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
0,season7,709candy,Monica," (closing the door) Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that
sign didnt work!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Yknow what would work?
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Hmm?
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Stop making candy!
0,season7,709candy,Monica, But they like it!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, You mean they like you.
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Maybe.
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny
man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)"
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and youll be fine.
Okay? Here we go. ReadySet"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,
maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane
seator a beanbag chair!"
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Phoebe, you cant get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how
to ride a bike!"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Why? Why do I have to learn?
0,season7,709candy,Ross, WellIn-in case of emergency.
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, What kind of an emergency?
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head
and says, ""You ride this bike or Ill shIll shoot you."""
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the
gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andHey! Ill hold
you up and-and push you. Okay?"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, You wont let go?
0,season7,709candy,Ross, No!
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Swear?!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, I swear!
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, (thinks it over) Okay. 
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They
start.) "
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, All right.
0,season7,709candy,Ross, All right. Feel good?
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Well
0,season7,709candy,Ross," All right, try pedaling. "
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Okay. (Does so.)
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Thats it, your doing great."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him
and falls off the bike.)"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
0,season7,709candy,Ross, I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself
from the angry looks from onlookers.)"
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Its a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the
woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!"
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? Ive
only got two hands!!"
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Need some help?
0,season7,709candy,Monica," No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing with
the system!"
0,season7,709candy,Ross," By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She
glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebes room.)"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," (seeing him) Oh, hello liar."
0,season7,709candy,Ross," (entering) Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, I couldve been killed I hope you know!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so
close Phoebe!"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have
no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something
that suspiciously looks like a bike.) "
0,season7,709candy,Ross, Phoebe.
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," All right, yknow what? If you are not going to learn how to ride
this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe, What?! Why?!
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this
guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be
played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride it
you-youre-youre killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) Youre making the bike very
happy."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)
Please dont die!"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but
were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office. Now, he doesnt get in
until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her
breakfast at her desk."
0,season7,709candy,Tag, Thats kinda sad.
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her
away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,
you get in the office."
0,season7,709candy,Tag, Got it!
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Lets roll!
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you
anythingminute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to
usher Tag out.)"
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some
chocolates? (Holds up the box.)"
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Umm, no. Thanks, but Ill give these to Betty. (Rachel glances
at Tag to say, ""See?"") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full
name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting
serious) what would happen exactly."
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Well, Id be forced to file a report. Id have to consult
with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Well
0,season7,709candy,Tag," (interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, Im the one who filled in that
evaluation."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Oh no-no-no
0,season7,709candy,Tag," (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny."
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner, You wrote that you have a cute tushie?
0,season7,709candy,Tag," (pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and Im kinda
strangely proud of my butt."
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Its kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing
I cant figure out what this is?"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," Youre lookin at it upside downyknow what? (Grabs
the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesnt matter."
0,season7,709candy,Mr. Zelner," Yeah, its not like I dont have a sense of humor, huh?
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But theres a time and a place,
huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh,
youve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Whoa! I cant believe you did that. That was really sweet.
0,season7,709candy,Tag," No, dont worry about it."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel," No, you couldve lost your job."
0,season7,709candy,Tag," Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, Id find work."
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, Thank you! Youre great! (They kiss.)
0,season7,709candy,Tag, Yknow what? 
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, What?
0,season7,709candy,Tag," I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its
contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, I It justit took me so long to get that desk organized.
0,season7,709candy,Tag," Oh, Im sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)"
0,season7,709candy,Rachel, (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? 
0,season7,709candy,The Man," Were waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the
candy!"
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Joey!
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Whats up buddy?
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, What are you doing?
0,season7,709candy,Joey, Waiting for candy.
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot
Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!
(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas."
0,season7,709candy,Monica," (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I
just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!
Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman
was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to
know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?"
0,season7,709candy,The Man, (from earlier) Candy Lady?
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
0,season7,709candy,Joey," (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have
candy?!!"
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it!
Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!"
0,season7,709candy,Joey," Thats right, its all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You
ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to
the candy and starts eating it.)"
0,season7,709candy,Monica, (To Chandler) Thank you.
0,season7,709candy,Chandler, Youre welcome. (They kiss.)
0,season7,709candy,Monica, Did you smoke?
0,season7,709candy,Chandler," No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Eh-uhare you okay?"
0,season7,709candy,Monica," Im fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,
someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door."
0,season7,709candy,Joey," (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or
whatever, I dont know (Grabs the note.)"
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," I cant believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought
Id be able to do that! Thank you Ross."
0,season7,709candy,Ross," Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced
her fears and ultimately overcame them."
0,season7,709candy,Phoebe," Dont be so corny Ross, its not an after-school special. (She
rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly
attached.)"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at
Michelles and tickets to the <i>Musicman</i> to celebrate our first holiday season
as a betroughed couple."
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Betrothed (Corrects him)
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, betrothed couple.
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, (entering carrying a skull) Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Pheebs?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Huh?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Skull?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (freaking out) Oh my god!!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she
used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people
still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of
licorice, and takes a bite.)"
0,season7,710towha,Ross, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,710towha,All, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Monica, (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for
the holidays this year."
0,season7,710towha,All, Ohh! That's great!
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this
year to teach him all about Hanukkah."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people
die."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
0,season7,710towha,Ross, Hmm.
0,season7,710towha,Joey, Hey. (He exits)
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, No.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, How long have we been home?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, About a half an hour.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Lovely!
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna
change your last name to Bing?"
0,season7,710towha,Monica, No.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Why not?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Bing's weird.
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get
ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the
good news."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Yeah, why not?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be
living with him."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," No reason, exceptshetoldme."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica
now."
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look
surprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,
""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not
hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""
Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this
world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Joey," Hey! Great, youre home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
(Starts drumming.)"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Drums?
0,season7,710towha,Joey, (yelling) No! Drums!
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
(Laughs.)"
0,season7,710towha,Monica," I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
0,season7,710towha,Maitre d'," Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the <i>Musicman</i> at 8
0,season7,710towha,Maitre d'," I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Is this because of the burrito thing?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Give him money? It was a joke!
0,season7,710towha,Monica," No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down.
Everybody wants to be paid off."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
0,season7,710towha,Monica, You've got to be smooth about it.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd
appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)"
0,season7,710towha,Maitre d'," Of course, sir."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
0,season7,710towha,Monica, How did it go?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the
money in it)"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do
ya?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, No.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you
uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Christmas.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Christmas eve.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesnt.) Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Santa has reindeers that can fly!
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,
years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees."
0,season7,710towha,Ben," (singing) <i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>..."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh
(Sings) <i>Draydl, draydl, draydl, I made you out of clay</i>."
0,season7,710towha,Ben," (singing) <i>Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer</i>..."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, When is Santa coming?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating
Hanukkah?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, No Santa? Was I bad?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Santa's mad at me.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is
not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, So Santa's coming?
0,season7,710towha,Ross, (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
0,season7,710towha,Monica," It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and
give him the money!"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, How do you know so much about this?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, I don't know.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
0,season7,710towha,Monica, We'd be eating our soup right now.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Mustached bastard
0,season7,710towha,Monica," (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!
Give him the money and get their table!"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his
money, but he isn't there anymore)"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (stopping at Phoebes entrance) Ha!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Yknow, I was worried,
that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,
apparently not! So, yay!"
0,season7,710towha,Joey," Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)
Ready? One, two, three, four..."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's
hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not
easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just
helping him to pick them up.) Thank you."
0,season7,710towha,Joey," Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey
Pheebs!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Joey, Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Hey Pheebs!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Hey! (she sits down next to him)
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire
building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a
phial of small pox to release in the hallway?"
0,season7,710towha,Monica," It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks
in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so
annoying."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react
to drums."
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live
there anymore?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Maybe on some level.
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the
air."
0,season7,710towha,Joey, What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you
another present. (She puts it on the counter)"
0,season7,710towha,Joey," Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what
is it?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," It's atarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool
jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,
gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I
had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my
cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
0,season7,710towha,Joey," Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into
his room)"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey
is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Our apartment is ready.
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, And that makes you angry because
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Because you would rather live here with Joey.
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Where did you get that?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And
apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Phoebe?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Hm?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the
apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you
know how fish freaked me out!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, (nods along) Fish!
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live
together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're
having so much fun over here"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," We did have fun, didn't we?"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, We did!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Oh, I would love to!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Yay, okay!"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the
sticks)"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and
puts the sticks into it) Done!"
0,season7,710towha,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,710towha,Salesman," Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," No, these are my pants."
0,season7,710towha,Salesman, Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
0,season7,710towha,Salesman," Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I
really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iuh, you gotta have something."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to
wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!"
0,season7,710towha,Monica," What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
0,season7,710towha,Ross, (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way
fromTexas."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Texas?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.
And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend
down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the
Lady will help me with these presents."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Wow! Thanks!
0,season7,710towha,Ross," You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
0,season7,710towha,Ben," Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," (gasps) You are? Me, too!"
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if
the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Cool!
0,season7,710towha,Ross, Yeah!
0,season7,710towha,Monica, Come on Ben.
0,season7,710towha,Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
0,season7,710towha,Ross," What are you doing here, Santa?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,
weirdturtle-man?"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to
give Ben some presents. Remember?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, What?
0,season7,710towha,Ben," Did you bring me any presents, Santa?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money
falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands
weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the
Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought
I'd say."
0,season7,710towha,Ross, (to Chandler) What are you doing?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa
costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Why?
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and
you're-youre wrecking it."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Fine, I'll give the suit back."
0,season7,710towha,Monica," (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a
really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Santa? Really?
0,season7,710towha,Monica," Yes, is that okay?"
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
0,season7,710towha,Monica, No.
0,season7,710towha,Chandler, Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, No! Why does he have to go?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo? (Ross nods) ...are
ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay."
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,
will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
0,season7,710towha,Ben," Okay, Santa!"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there
were these people called the Maccabees."
0,season7,710towha,Joey, (entering wearing a <i>Superman</i> costume) Merry Christmas!
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Oh wow! Look at this place!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Oh, this is terrible. Oh, theyve made so many changes I cant
even feel my grandmothers presence anymoreOoh! New sconces!"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, What?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your
grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Yeah?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find
out and then tear it down?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Yeah?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Do you really not know where Im going with this? (Phoebe nods,
""No."") It left! Its one huge room!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, See?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Well, I guess well just have to put the wall back up."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," You cant, because of the new skylight!"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Theres a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)
Wow!!"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," (returning slowly) Yknow Im-Im sensing that um, my
grandmother would not be comfortable with that."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Oh yeah? Startin to feel her again there are we?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," A little bit, yeah."
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, You heard her too?! You have the gift!
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Phoebe, its okay. I like living with Joey."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Are you sure?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Oh please, I hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun.
Although, Im really gonna miss living with you."
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Oh me too.
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,
Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep
the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," No, I do not hear that."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve
just lasted just one day, burned for"
0,season7,710towha,Ben, (answering him) Eight whole days.
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The
end."
0,season7,710towha,Ben, Awesome!
0,season7,710towha,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,710towha,Chandler," My favorite part was when <i>Superman</i> flew all the Jews out of
Egypt. (Glaring at Joey whos nodding.)"
0,season7,710towha,Ross," The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay
Ben, its time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, <i>Superman</i>, Monica, Ben,
and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, (entering with Phoebe) Hey! 
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter
Bunnys funeral in here."
0,season7,710towha,Ross," Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Oh.
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season7,710towha,Phoebe," Okay, I understand why <i>Superman</i> is here, but why is there a
porcupine at the Easter Bunnys funeral?"
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, I got it!
0,season7,710towha,Joey, (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel, Its back in cage!
0,season7,710towha,Joey, Cage closed?
0,season7,710towha,Rachel," Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Ohh. Mmm.
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I(Chandler
puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,
this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to
look at the label on the box.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent
it to us."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.
Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't
return a box after you've opened the box."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Why, why not?"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Because it's too delicious.
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send
away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake
conglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,
Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," (taking a bite) Oh, Im sorry, what?"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," All right, I should get going, big day at work. Yknow Im in a
coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, So
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, its just my character thats
not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Absolutely!
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Ill see you at 8
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Okay. (Joey exits.) 
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Oh, whats at 8"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to
discuss the rest of you guys."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Duly noted.
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,
do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, What are you talking about?
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Cousin Frannies wedding, it's tomorrow night."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, You were invited?!
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, No.
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were
invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were
inseparable!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt
Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids
her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnt
have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Yknow, she tried to undress me too."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then
shushes
him.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Umm, I think hes still out. Whats wrong?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Well, Ill tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey
tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," (reading the note) ""Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk to
you later. Big Daddy."" (Laughs) Big Daddy?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica
shakes her head in disgust.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for
sex!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Phoebe hes right, that is the rule."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," I dont accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show
up. Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!
Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their
friendship) is for life!"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Well, it does."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? Im sorry. (They hug.) How
about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! Ill pay for myself!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Okay, you wore me down."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Hey Joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the
Ross-A-Tron?"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, The RossIs that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, I cant seem to say goodbye.
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and
you want more?"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham
cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling (Pause) Wow! My
whole mouth just filled with saliva! "
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," (closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are just
hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not
tempted."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the
cheesecake.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Awww! Mel Torme died.
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Joey, that papers like a year old!"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Aw! Does that mean the <i>Sam Goodys</i> sale is over?!
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, (entering) Hey.
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Hey.
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasnt
a mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Well yeah, but she doesnt know that. I mean, the last time she saw
you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. "
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thats
not the reason shes not inviting me!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Oh whats the big deal?! I wasnt even invited to the ceremony,
just the reception. And-and yknow what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I
will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a
sign of protest."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Joan?
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. Shes an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not
broad backed!"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and
you got ""and guest?!"""
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think
the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, (interrupting) Not broad backed!
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, What? I cant cancel on Joan!
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Why not?!
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," BecDid you not hear me?! Shes an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department, okay? Theyre wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Because! Shes my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! Were
family yknow? Well thats important to me."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Okay, all right, Ill take you. Ill go call Joan. (Does so.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Aww thats nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,
happiest day of her life."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, (laughs) Well see.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Well, thank you for lunch."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs
then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman
is still lying in front of her door.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to
come back to bad cheesecake."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, No that could kill her.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Well, we dont want that."
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," No, so were protecting her."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, But we should take it.
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, But we should move quick.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Why?
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake
and they take off upstairs.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! Thats David!
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, David who?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went
to Russia and broke my heart David!"
0,season7,711towcc,David, (noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around."
0,season7,711towcc,David, Phoebe?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Arent
you supposed to be in Russia?"
0,season7,711towcc,David," Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm, God
you look phenomenal!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
0,season7,711towcc,David, Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season7,711towcc,David," Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season7,711towcc,David," Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didnt know whether I
should call or not, yknow I-I was only in town for a few days. And yknow, I
didnt want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted
to see you andbut I didnt know if you wanted to see me."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Well, of course I would want to see you. II think about you all
the time."
0,season7,711towcc,David, Really? Because I think about you all the time. 
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Really?
0,season7,711towcc,David," I mean, theres a statue in Minsk"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season7,711towcc,David," That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-its actually
of Lenin. But, yknow at certain angles"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season7,711towcc,David," Umm, anywayDo you want to have dinner tonight?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, (excited) Yes! Oh no! 
0,season7,711towcc,David," (disappointed) Oh. Uh, what?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," I cant. I cant believe I have plans, I cant. Can you
do it tomorrow night though?"
0,season7,711towcc,David," Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well
listen, yknow, next time youre in Minsk umm"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, What are you doing?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Well, I have plans with Joey tonight."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, So! Hell understand!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," No he wont. And thats not even the point! Monica, I made a
whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now yknow what? Just
because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I
should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I dont have my
principles, I dont have anything!"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," God, you are so strong."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret
it."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, (seeing what theyre doing) What do you got there?
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a
disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, What are you doing tonight?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Huh? Uh (He starts taking off his pants.)
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with
Phoebe, why?"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, What?! Tonight?!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Thats what Monica said.
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy
on the same night she has plans with me? I think shes trying to pull a fast one on
Big Daddy!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut. (To the couple
sitting to her right.) Hi!"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt
get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," (To Monica) Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the
happy couple?"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Okay, youre fine."
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter, Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter, Are you guys ready?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and waters
fine."
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter, Okay.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Okay. 
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter, (To Joey) And for you sir?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin here?"
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter," Its uh, its already been roasted."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh Joey, weve heard the specials three times! Okay? Theres
prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it
to the waiter.)"
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter," Actually were out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joeys
menu under his arm.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it
again. The waiter leaves.) Yknow what Pheebs?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Huh?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," You were right before. I mean, friends are so important."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," (checking her watch) Yeah, Im very wise. I know."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Yknow-yknow what I really want?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, What?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Is to have a long, long talk. Yknow? Get Joey out on the open road
and really open him up."
0,season7,711towcc,The Waiter, (returning) Any progress?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," God Joey, this is taking forever!"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Whats the rush? What?
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," W-wI justits thatI haveyknow I
have-I have an appointment. And its very important."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Well Its a date.
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you
wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," No, Im gonna!! Thats right! Yeah, you made me feel really
guilty about goin out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to
you! And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," ThatIts not the same thing! This is totally
different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, hes very
special to me."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist
too!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, She was?
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Well, she graduated from high school!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Okay, whatever. Yknow what? I dont have time to
convince you because hes only here for four hours, and Im gonna go see him!
(Gets up and leaves.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Fine!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Fine!
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Yeah! (She exits.)
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," (to the waiter) What are you still doin here?! I told you, lobster
ravioli!"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,711towcc,David," Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were
coming."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh, I wouldnt miss this."
0,season7,711towcc,David," Well, Im very glad youre here. (Kisses her hand.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh, youre such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! Were
going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to
whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the
cheesecake without me?!"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are
you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are
dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And I
got it first, and Im takin it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his
apartment.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, What?! What?!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Oh yes! 
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Wait a minute!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Oh yes!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Oh yes! Oh yes!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," You think I trust you with it?! No! Were gonna split it! You take
half and I take half!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Well thats not fair, youve already had some!"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be very
interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, What do we use to split it?
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh
Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," All right, Ill pick that one. (Points.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Thats also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,
there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and
dont come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast. (As shes saying
that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her
place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!"
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece."
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler," Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come
crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the
hallway and eat my (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.
That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little
bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.) "
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Oh, hey Aunt Millie."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Yes, yes it is. Its uh (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to
grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a
napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? (Starts to
get up and greet Frannie.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so
you can ambush her."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Frannie was the one who found your <i>Playboys</i> and showed them to
mom."
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on
Frannies shoulder.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Frannie, (turning around) Monica! What
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you
like that?!"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations."
0,season7,711towcc,Monica," You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!
(Frannies husband walks up.) Stuart!"
0,season7,711towcc,Frannie, I believe you know my husband.
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, So its really a question of who could you have possibly done.
0,season7,711towcc,David," Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I cant miss my
flight."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in
like"
0,season7,711towcc,David," July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.) "
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
0,season7,711towcc,David," Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
0,season7,711towcc,David," Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I
figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it. 
0,season7,711towcc,David, I-I do though.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe, I do too. (They kiss.)
0,season7,711towcc,David," Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and
witnesses that event.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," (seeing him) Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell
at me tomorrow."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," No! No! No Pheebs, Im not gonna yell at you. I just yknow,
started thinking about you and David and Iremember how bummed you were the first
time he left. And I just Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?"
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," No Im not okay. The only guy Ive ever been crazy about has
gone to Minsk and I may neverI may never see him again. (Crying.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," Hey, yknow you could always visit him."
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," Oh right, like theyre gonna let me have a passport."
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
0,season7,711towcc,Phoebe," WellButNow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of
sub-atomic particles yknow before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey, I can give it a shot.
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel, Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
0,season7,711towcc,Chandler, Stick to your side!
0,season7,711towcc,Rachel," Hey, come on now!"
0,season7,711towcc,Joey," (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin? (Starts digging
in.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Monica, Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt
Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her
attention.)"
0,season7,711towcc,Ross, Well
0,season7,711towcc,Ross," Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monicas wrap and
walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," (looking up) Ross, whens this comet thing start?"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Well, technically it started seven billion years ago (Well,
technically youd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see
it with all of the bright lights of New York.)"
0,season7,712tuan,All, (groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up and leave.)
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay! Okay! Fine, Ill stop! No teaching, okay? Well just watch
the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets dont streak across the sky,
meteors do.) Okay? Whos official name is Bapstein-King."
0,season7,712tuan,All, Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature
amazing?"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, (looking up with her) Thats a plane!
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, thats
pretty amazing too."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here."
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," No. No, you cant."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, What?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel, Oh I dont-I dont know.
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from
the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesnt it?"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Yknow what
else makes you wonder?"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Huh?
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross
and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and
starts looking for the comet.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen
any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. (She walks over
to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," (with a quivering voice) No, Im not!"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on
Monica! (He goes inside.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Yeah actually, I think were gonna take off too. We rented a movie."
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Oh! I wont say, no to a movie!"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone."
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe, Shh! Get me out of here.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, (whispering) Ross!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, What?
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Come here, check this out!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joeys standing.)
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down
to get a closer look.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the
Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care
about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," (standing up) Yknow, theres two women dude."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Show me where?
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey wheres the pipe
that was holding the door open?"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," (annoyed) I dont know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)
(Pause) Yeah, I do."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Joey!
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who
wanted to come up and look for some stupid <i>Burger King</i> comet!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)
Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! "
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the
door.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, (whispering) Monica!
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Shes sleeping.
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was <i>Deep
Impact</i> and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>?"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," <i>Deep Impact</i> was the one with Robert Duval, <i>Armageddon</i> is
whats going to happen to you if you wake me up."
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and
Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were
ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I
look at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will
kick you in the shin."
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and
heads into the living room.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please dont be a space
ship. Please dont be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and
finds that its the smoke detector thats beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a
chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she
yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets
there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)
How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can"
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe, Dont interrupt me!!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Rachel!! Monica!!
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Come on!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, I cant believe this!!
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," All right well, yknowI guess we know what we have to do to get
down."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we dont have a
choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! Were stuck up on the roof
and we cant get down!!!"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it
out.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," (To Joey) I know, I wasnt finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)
(Yelling at the street) But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!!"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Id
make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," With a wok? (Chandlers holding a wok.) I thought you were going to
read my boring book to put you asleep."
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway."
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? We
can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were
first going out. Itd be fun!"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Okay that does sound like fun. 
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, The second sister dies?!
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, The second sister dies in <i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>?
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, Thats correct.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel, You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Sure.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send
those contracts to Milan?"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that its not
working.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight
them?"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, What contracts?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that
I dont get."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Like what?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He
starts laughing.) Tag! Im serious! This isnt funny! Those contracts absolutely
had to go out today!"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Yes I did! And I put a little <i>Post-It</i> on it that said, ""Must
go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in
the corner because I didnt want to seem too bossy."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Im telling you, you never gave them to me."
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those
contracts sitting on your desk."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my
desk!"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on
the phone with your crotch!"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, You wanna go down to the office right now?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldnt want to be proved wrong
either."
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel
suddenly stops and sticks her hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook
this? (Her bra.) Nice work!"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," All right, it wont go down any further. Its stuck."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Ugh. Well, were just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.
Now, were gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish
red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down thereyou go up to the
roof and you let me in."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Yeah! Oh yeah, youll be fine! It-itll be uh, just like bungy
jumping. Yknow? But instead of bouncing back up you-you wont."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, What if I smack my head on the concrete?
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Well, Im not gonna lie to you Joey, its a possibility."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," (looks at the ground and at Ross) I dont know Ross! I-I tell you
what, lets flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the
landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, No.
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay. Well, you be careful."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! Im not jumping! Okay, look I have an
audition tomorrow and I cant go if I break my leg."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Well Im not jumping! I have a son! Okay? He wont have a father
if-if I die!"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Well all right so, it looks like were even!"
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.
(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to
do (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up
and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has
stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance
to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke
detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees
that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, (startled) What? What? What?
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? Im sorry. Here. (Hands the
mug of milk to him.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not
on this desk."
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean,
this is what Im talking about! You have to be organized! Youve got newspapers!
Youve got magazines! You gotOhh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A
little young for you Tag, but whatever."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Its my sister.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the point is
Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes
into her office.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the
afternoon?"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put
them on my desk, and then I put a <i>Post-It</i> on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds
the folder with the <i>Post-It</i> on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave
Tag) that said, ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All
right?"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Its not here.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room,
maybe you left the contracts in there?"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, How could I have left them in the copy room?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?
Its not a perfect world! Just go please."
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Fine.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom
drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the
phone.) I still dont get it."
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Are you still awake?
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, Yeah! You?
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesnt
respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as were both up"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinking
about cleaning the living room."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do
you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," (looking in the window behind them) Yknow, yknow Im
lookin and I dont think anyones home here. I say we just break the
window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Yeah? Really? No ones home?
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," I dont think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,
large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the
landing.) When you get in there (Joey nods his disapproval.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the
chute.) Noisy bitch!"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, What?! What are you doing?!
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, Do you know what just happened?
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, No. We were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked
my
world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, (turning the light back on) Monica?
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, What?!
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please
wake up so we can do it right!"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!"
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Give me the good stuff.
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay,
I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as
hes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over
the kitchen floor."
0,season7,712tuan,Monica," Okay, Im up! Im up!"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh (She looks for a place to set it
on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) fair enough. So! Do
you got anything for me?"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Still no luck.
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the
drawers!"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, Do you want me to check again?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no
its not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one
and he opens it. She doesnt see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," Well, its not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your
office?"
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," (thinks) Yknow, I dont-I dont know. Let me, let me
check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her shoulder at Tag, looks into
her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, (smirking) Any luck?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel, Can I see you in my office for a minute?
0,season7,712tuan,Tag," (entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not
amused, because shes still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every
good boss.) Yknow what? Im not even going to gloat. Im just
really relieved this whole thing is over."
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel, You put these on my desk!
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, I did not!
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," Oh really? So youre saying they just slid out of your
bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think <i>Dogbert</i>
should have a line here.)"
0,season7,712tuan,Tag, How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
0,season7,712tuan,Rachel," (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I
am so hot for you right now."
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe, Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the
blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?"
0,season7,712tuan,The Fireman, We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe, Thats not mine.
0,season7,712tuan,The Fireman, Yes it is.
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe, How do you know?
0,season7,712tuan,The Fireman," The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,
dont wrap it in a blanket that says, ""Property of Phoebe Buffay not
Monica."""
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last
time I checked this was still America!"
0,season7,712tuan,The Fireman," Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them."
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them
from going off!"
0,season7,712tuan,The Fireman, Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
0,season7,712tuan,Phoebe," Theres a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and
she goes to shut it off.) Theres a reset button! My God! Why didnt I see that!
(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,
where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)
Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to
the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,
God!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay, do-do you have a good grip?"
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Yeah!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay, Im going to start climb down you now."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, All right! Just hurry up!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so were face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so were-were butt to face."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, I think face to face.
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, I would say that.
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Face to face, yeah!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Okay, here I go."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, All right. 
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, (grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," I prefer not to answer that right now, Im still carrying a little
holiday weight."
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we
thought it all the way through."
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, So what do you want me to do?
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Hi.
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Hi.
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Its still looks pretty far!
0,season7,712tuan,Joey, Its not that far! Just drop!
0,season7,712tuan,Ross, Do not rush me!!
0,season7,712tuan,Joey," Ross, you should know that my pants are startin to come down and
Im not wearing any underwear!"
0,season7,712tuan,Ross," Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when
IOoh, a quarter!"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, That really was some of your best work.
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I cant believe that
Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, I have to be up in seven minutes.
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler," Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven
minutes"
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Really?!
0,season7,712tuan,Chandler, Do you wanna?
0,season7,712tuan,Monica, Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Hey.
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, What are you doing?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Well, yknow I was thinking of moving the couch over here."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, (laughs) Why would you want to do that?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Rach, there is a decent place to"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on, help me move this."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, No. No. No.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, No?
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, No. Rosita does not move.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Im sorry, Rosita? As in"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, As in Rosita does not move.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Joey, its just a chair! Whats the big deal?"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to
the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming off
of Stevie."
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Stevie the TV?
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, (glaring at her) Is there a problem?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)
Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling
on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Hey, yknow whats weird? After you guys get married, when you
introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law
Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" Thats
weird isnt it?"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Couldnt I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the
uh, real estate section"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Oh, it looks like mom and dads house. Oh, it even has a tree with a
broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!!"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, I cant believe they-they didnt even tell us!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the window
in the attic!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!
(Listens) Yes were surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to
move your mom, and you said dont, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Okay, come onJoey, Ill buy you a new one! All right?
Well go down to the store right now and well-well get you a new chair."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, (slowly turning and glaring at her) Shes not even cold yet!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," But dont you think Rosita wouldve wanted you to move on? I
mean yknow, she did always putyour comfort first."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Thats true.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Yeah, I (Shuts off the TV.) I dont want Stevie to see her like
this."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," I cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
Man, some-some strangers gonna be living in my room."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,
its time the velvet ropes came down."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, They kept your room for a while.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I
gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of <i>Victorias Secret</i> catalogues, not a
gym!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Come on, you know they love you."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, As much as they love you?
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," I was their first born! They thought she was barren! Its not my
fault."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Hey.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Ugh, I hate this year!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Whats wrong with this year?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Well okay, its already February and Ive only given two
massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, That was me and Ross.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, Oh thats right!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of
mine made good money doing telemarketing."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Oh thats a great idea. Youre really good on the phone.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone
job I had. Yknow, I probably wouldnt have to say spank as much. (Monica and
Ross are shocked.) "
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, What?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh yeah, like you never called!"
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor," So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to
sell as much toner as you possibly can."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office."
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor, (laughs) Why dont we do a trial run.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the
script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply
manager please?"
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor, Im the supply manager.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor, We dont need any toner.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh okay, well Im sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the
phone.) Yeah youre right, this is easy."
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor," Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor," Theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner,
but thats okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this
script."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor," So, I think youre ready to sell toner, do you have any last
questions?"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Joey! Joe! (Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. He
picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold.
Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its not that
important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh
no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Dad?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Im here!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, (entering with Monica) Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to
watch me work."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house."
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here
and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the
asbestos in the ceiling."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, (To Monica) Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of
the memories"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do
know there are six or seven <i>Easy Bake Ovens</i> in the attic."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, I used to love to play restaurant.
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light
bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," So, I think your boxes are over here. (They walk over to
them.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-whos
cigarettes are these?"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," I dont know. They-they must be your mothers, but please,
please dont ask her. Ill throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Ross
finds something of interest in one of his boxes.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym(He puts it away and finds something else.)
Oooh, my rock polisher!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Oh look, look theres your old makeup kit!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Its a clown kit! Clown kit!
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into the
box as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, What?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Yknow how the garage floods every Spring?
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, How are you ever going to sell this place?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," I think I accidentally used Monicas boxes to keep the water
away from the <i>Porsche</i>."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Oh no. Dad! Dad! What(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips
apart.) Oh Godeverythings ruined! Dad, shes gonna be crushed!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, You dont secretly smoke do you?
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, No!
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, So its just your mother then.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to
your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from
Empire Office Supplies Id like to talk to you about your toner needs. (Shes
reading from the script.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, I dont need any toner.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Im hearing what youre saying, but at our prices everyone
needs toner."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Not me.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, May I ask why?
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, I surely do!
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Okay, I dont need any toner because Im going to kill myself."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," (doesnt have any luck) Umm, is-is that because youre out of
toner?"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to
me."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," WellI only have one thing to do today. (He looks at his board in his
office that reads, ""Todays Tasks"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this
meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, Chandler?
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, I-Im sorry?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. Ive been talking
to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from
their desk. Hang-hang on. (To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh,
Im gonna kill myself! (Theres no response; no one even looks up.) Ill
get back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge!
(Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the
wall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (To
Phoebe) Ehh, nothing. Nothing."
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the
door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming
up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, You will like it!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, No I wont.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, You dont even know!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Because, I know what I like and what I dont like! Its not the
same thing!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Well look, if you dont like this(The audiences
laughter at Chandlers progress cuts out the rest of Rachels line.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, I dont know why you say that so soon.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in
the store! Hey, yknow what I was thinking? We could name her Francette."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Francette? What is she? A couch?
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually
move Rosita out of here. Yknow, start the healing process?"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Well, I guess youre right. Maybe, maybe Ill take her down to
the incinerator. Its gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,
but it doesnt come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and
looks back at it.) Shes healed!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Thats weird.
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," No its not weird, its a miracle!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Its not a miracle Joey! Im sure theres some
explanation."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous
things can happen!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Joey, I really dont"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Well no.
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Miracle!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," No, yknow what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or
something!"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Someone like anangel?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Thats right Joey, the chair angel came in and healed your chair.
(She sits down in the chair.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads
for her room.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on
purpose."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Dad, that wont matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and
all hers is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her
think you guys love me more than you love her."
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Oh my God, does she really thinks that?"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Well, can you blame her?"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you
unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Dad, dad I dont want to hear about it."
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Really?
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and
damnit, were gonna give her some! Okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. Okay?
Well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers
well-well put em in there. "
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Great!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Like uh yknow like this! This! (He picks up one of those art
projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she couldve made this!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Sure!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she couldve won this!
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, (grabbing a glove) This couldve been hers!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Your make-up kit? Id feel better.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," (grabbing a beer out of the chairs fridge) I am so psyched I kept
this chair for myself!"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Hey, howshows the uh, miracle chair?"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Fine.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Yeah? Wow! Yknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, No. Really?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, (quietly) My chair heals itself.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Earl, youre not hearing me! All Im saying is that
youre not alone, alright? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her
coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didnt mean him.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," No! Thats just the ""Hey Guy"" guy. He says that to
everybody! Hes the worst! Id like to take him with me!"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," All right. So Earl, lets just forget about the people at the
office, okay? There-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around
for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, (laughs) Yeah! Right!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh sorry, boyfriend!"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Oh no.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No, whatever! Anything!"
0,season7,713towrd,"The ""Hey Guy"" Guy", Hey guy!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Yeah, hes gotta go."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
(Hangs up.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No! Im not finished yet! Dont! Dont you dare hang up
on me!!!"
0,season7,713towrd,Supervisor," (walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff) The new
girls good."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Hey guys! Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Hey.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Hey, I just whipped us up some <i>Easy Bake</i> treats, they should be
ready in about three days."
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," (overacting) Thats a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three
days!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great
memory."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just
created for her.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it
up.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never
went anywhere without-without that coloring book."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines."
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You
never went any place without that glove."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I cant believe I even fit
into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Oh, I dont know how that got in there."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isnt mine. (Sets it down and
looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! Ugh,
Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Umm, your boxes are umm"
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, What?
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, Dad?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your
boxes. Im sorry."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Just mine?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, Im afraid so.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," So why-why wasnt Rosss stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say
the words medical marvel Im going to <i>Easy Bake</i> your head!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the <i>Porsche</i>."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," So wait, Rosss stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you
wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, I cant believe this! (Storms out.)
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," (To Ross) Screw it! Im having one. (Takes out and lights a
cigarette.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Hey Chandler!
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling
massage, and speakers in the head rest?"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they
wont even let me in the store anymore."
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is
making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of
the Year?"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," I just purchased the <i>La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000</i>. (Which is an actual
product by the way, Im not sure about the 3000 part.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced
it with mine!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Ohhhhh. Thats how it got fixed!
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Im gettin my chair back! (Heads for Joey and
Rachels.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, What? Wh-hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," Well, it looks like it wasnt healed after all! Yeah! So, I guess
this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, Joey you broke my chair!!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Your chair?!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," So, there was no miracle?!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," No Joe, no miracle."
0,season7,713towrd,Joey," (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. Im so
glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life."
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right?
That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, I think I should get the chair!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, How do you figure?
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to
Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler," Well, wheres the logic in that?!"
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to
break a chair in half!"
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Thats right!
0,season7,713towrd,Chandler, What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Yeah! We are!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Were the Cobras!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? Hes
the supply manager around here."
0,season7,713towrd,Marge," Sorry, I dont know any Earl."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, (screaming) Im right here!!!!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, (goes over to his desk) Earl! Im Phoebe.
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Umm, look it, you-you cant kill yourself."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," (exhales) Look, um I really appreciate your coming down"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, No-no I cant! I cant let you do it!
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Why?!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, Because it was fate that made me call you today!
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, I thought it was toner.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No! Think about it okay? This isnt even my regular job!
Okay? And my first day on the job, youre my first call! And-and somebody else
mightve hung up on you, but I wouldnt do that because I know about this stuff.
My mom killed herself."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Really?!
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe, Yes.
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, How?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Im not gonna give you tips! Look dont you see that
this-thisthis all came together so that I could stop you from doing this."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Couldnt it just be a coincidence?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," No, its fate!"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, It doesnt really seem like enough to be fate.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh. Well umm, okay heres a weird thing. My mother was also a
supply manager."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Im actually the office manager.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,
right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," Well, was there anything else?!"
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Philadelphia.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps. (She
holds out her arm.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, (inspecting it) Really?
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Yeah-yeah.
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the
universe does! And that says a lot!"
0,season7,713towrd,Earl," (To All) Did you hear that?! I dont need you guys to care about me!
Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To
Phoebe) I really wished theyd care just a little bit though."
0,season7,713towrd,Phoebe," Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you. This is a
freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, its you."
0,season7,713towrd,Earl, Yeah.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Oh, this is terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She
picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I
dont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft. (She rubs it against her
cheek.) What do you think this is?"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, All right. I think it was a mouse.
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, (entering) How are you honey?
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," How do you think I am?! Youve wrecked all my childhood memories.
You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, Im sorry
about everything that happened and Id probably never be able to make it up to you,
but heres a start. (He hands her a small box.)"
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, (opening it) Whats this?
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Its the key to my <i>Porsche</i>. Well, the key to your <i>Porsche</i>."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, (shocked) What?!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross, (even more shocked) What?!!!
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller," Ive been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it
the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mothers right, I do
look like an ass."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Wait, youre giving me your <i>Porsche</i>, youre kidding me
right?!"
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid
boxes get wet and she gets a <i>Porsche</i>?!"
0,season7,713towrd,Mr. Geller, (To Monica) Why dont we take it for a spin?
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, All right!
0,season7,713towrd,Ross," Well, what about me?! Im a medical marvel!!"
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Oh yeah.
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Ahhhh.
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Ahhh (To Rachel) Eh?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, (entering) Hey guys!
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,713towrd,Monica, Do you guys know what happened to Chandlers barcalounger?
0,season7,713towrd,Rachel," Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
0,season7,713towrd,Monica," Are you kidding?! I get a <i>Porsche</i> and the barcaloungers
gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Happy birthday!!!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Happy birthday!!!
0,season7,714tat30,All, Rach! Come on! Rach!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Its your birthday!
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, (entering from her room) Hey.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, (To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
She would appreciate it if you dont use the words old or downhill or (To Joey) they
still look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, They do!
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Chocolate-chip pancakes!
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Weve got presents!
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Good ones?
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not
me!! (He buries his head in Phoebes lap for comfort.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Yknow, Im still 29 in Guam."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to
this?"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly
wasnt that much fun."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," (screaming) And now Chandler! Were all gettin so old! (Looking
up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve
got a great job! Good friends"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Look, yknow I know my lifes going pretty well, but I look
around and I just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by the
time theyre thirty."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me."
0,season7,714tat30,All, Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, There you go!
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! Thats it!! Thats
everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with
my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a
Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head
into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs.
Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!"
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," Come on, lets have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you want to do
today?"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Nothing. I dont want to do anything.
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something
stupid, like Ross."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!
Okay? I-I have a child!"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," How hot do I look in this, huh?!"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a
sock down there?"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Thats not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I
have always been into cars."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," (giddy) I dont know, but-but look how shiny!"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, I cant believe you bought this.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know
its really shallow, but a part of me wants him again."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. 
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," (getting out) Okay, whos next?"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Yknow what? I am going to do something today. Im not just
gonna sit around like some old lady. Im gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,
like my nose or my tongue or something."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Really?! Cause yknow that hurts.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," So what?! Yknow what? The way I see it(Phoebe pulls out a
hair from the back of her head)Ow! Son of a bitch!!"
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," Look Rachel, I know what youre going through. Im totally
freaked about turning 25."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. "
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," All right Rach, for what its worth, I think that youre doing
great. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Least of all you.
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Why? What youd do?
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Werent you asked to leave sonny?
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any
minute!"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, But it hurts my Joeys Apple.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. Its not named for each
individual man."
0,season7,714tat30,Mrs. Geller," (To Chandler) Youve done a wonderful job with this party
Chandler. Everything looks so lovely."
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that you
would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe that
you would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Gellers
shoulder.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Mr. Geller," Its older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near
this tuxedo."
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the
lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the
assemblage.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Mr. Geller, Crap.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out
whats going on."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Hey-hey are you drunk?
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and
Joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.
She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a
little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out
for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise
party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Noo!!!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Yes!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Noo!!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Yes!!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and
they will never know that youre drunk."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Really?! You promise?
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Yeah, Ill take care of it."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise
party. So, when you go in, act surprised."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Okay. I can do that.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,714tat30,All, Surprise!!!
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Okay, forward. ForwardStop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to
the back of the car.) Okay, backStop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to
the front.) Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in."
0,season7,714tat30,Woman, (To Joey) Is this yours?
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Well actually
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," No-no-no! Its mine! Its-its mine. (The woman walks
away.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Dude, you soooo need this car."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," (running up) Okay. Okay, heres what were gonna do. Okay,
Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so
Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and
reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.
She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!
(Runs off.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) Its
for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!"
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Right, why do you keep saying that?"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Because its our thirtieth birthday.
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Yeah, no were not thirty. Were 31. Okay. (She closes the
door.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Oh, its you."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Yeah. What?!
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Yeah, were not thirty, were 31."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Nu-uh!
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, Yea-huh! Thats what is says on my birth certificate.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, You have your birth certificate?
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Our mom.
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, (sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Do you have my birth certificate?
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31."
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, Yeah.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, I just lost a whole year of my life.
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, (sarcastic) Okay.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Your middle name is Pamela?
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, Yes.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?"
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula, Yes! Phoebe.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Thats my first name.
0,season7,714tat30,Ursula," Right, okay, then no."
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her
party dress."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Yay!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,
and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller
whos standing next to him.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Mr. Geller," Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Mrs. Geller," (stopping him) Dont get up Jack! The safety pins are about to
blow."
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, (sees someone) Paul!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, (correcting her) Phil.
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Phil!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the
steps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre
doing fine."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Hey, whats going on?"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Monicas a little drunk.
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Yay! I love drunk Monica!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Awwwww (Giggles.)
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parents
to know shes drunk."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Ohh! All right! All right. Heres what well do, Ill get
twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Monicas wasted.
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Maybe that will liven up this party.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Yep. (Starts for Monicas room, but Chandler stops him.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, (handing his to her) This ones from me.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Ahh!
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its
really fun."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, (opening it) A scooter! (Shes not happy.)
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) "
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you
guys?"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read
the card! Read the card!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Its
better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as
everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) Thats funny,
yeah!"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," (crying) No, I know! I get it! Its funny!"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," No, because youre not a grandmother!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have
children and I dont have any of those things. Thats why its so funny.
(Runs into her room crying.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, All you had to do was buy the card!
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the
birthday girl feeling?"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the
kids."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes
and sits down.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not
having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three
kids"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you
wanna have them for your brother."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids
by the time Im 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this
plan!"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," If you could do that, Id marry the hippity-hop."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," So, if I wanna have my kid when Im 35, I dont have to get
pregnant until Im 34. Which gives <i>Prada</i> four years to start making maternity
clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To
Chandler) Look all you want, its happening!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," No, so I dont have to get married until Im 33! Thats
three years, thats three whole yearsOh, wait a minute though. Ill need a
year and a half to plan the wedding, and Id like to know the guy for a year, year
and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time
Im thirty."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Which is fine! Because you just turned(Removes two candles
from the cake)twenty-eight!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should
already be with the guy I wanna marry!"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Will you quit hoggin it!
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," (To Chandler) Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn
how to walk."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," (To Monica) Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe
Im a little drunk."
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of
that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not
tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, (To Monica) How are you feeling?
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right
now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, I really wish that you wouldnt.
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit
more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the
birthday girl! Huh?"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Pheebs!!
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans
working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!"
0,season7,714tat30,Mrs. Geller, Speech! Come on Monica!
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Come on!
0,season7,714tat30,All, Come on! Speech!
0,season7,714tat30,Mr. Geller," (filming this) Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her
for one second!"
0,season7,714tat30,Mrs. Geller," Oh-ho, I think its nice."
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, I think its necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," I really like to say that Im-um (Pause) Yknow what
Id really like to say? Im drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.)
Thats right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera
out of his dads hands.) And guess what! Ive been drunk before! And Ive
smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of <i>Ding-Dongs</i> hidden in my underwear drawer!
Its all okay. Its okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do
anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming
the fall.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Yeah!!
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, I lost a whole year! I cant believe it! This is so unfair!
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Oh, I dont know Pheebs. Itll be okay."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were
31?"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Thats not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! II havent done any of
the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Like what?
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," Like okay I-I-I, I havent met any Portuguese people! I, I
havent had the perfect kiss! And I havent been to snipers school!"
0,season7,714tat30,Monica," Phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have some
birthday cake?"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe," No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? Ill
see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home.
(Gets up and runs out.) "
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Oh man!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, What?
0,season7,714tat30,Monica, Hes gonna eat the cake!
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and
Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe thats one thing you can cross off your list."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Oh yeah.
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Oh, and plus Im 1/16<sup>th</sup> Portuguese."
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it.
Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna lift the carand slide it
out. Lift and slide!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Ross, I really dont think"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Okay, here we go."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," All right everyone, lift! (They try to lift the car, of course it
doesnt raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Hey Joey, can I"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Whatever! Okay, Im not your mother."
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Not in the street!!
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, Yes!
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, (to Tag) Hi.
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Hey.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Hey.
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Yeah, Im doing okay. Im umlets talk."
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Okay. (They sit on the step.)
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel, Umm
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Whats up?
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Ohh Tag, ummyoure such a great guy and we have sooo much fun
together but I dont-I dont"
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," Wait! I think I see where youre going, but before you say anything
else, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but
I just think Im past the point where I think I can yknow, just have fun."
0,season7,714tat30,Tag," Rachel, dont do this. This is just because youre turning
thirty."
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Yeah, it is! But youre just a kid! I mean youre 25!"
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Twenty-four actually.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Oh God! Yknow what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well
actually, if Im wishin for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger."
0,season7,714tat30,Tag, Me too.
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Yeah, Im sorry. (They hug.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler, Hey! Howd it go?
0,season7,714tat30,Rachel," Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?"
0,season7,714tat30,Phoebe, You did the right thing.
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore.
(He sits down with them in pain.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Chandler," Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
0,season7,714tat30,Ross," God, do you realize in ten years were gonna be 40?"
0,season7,714tat30,Joey," (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in
Rosss shoulder.)"
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, Yes! My babys finally free! 
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Lets go!
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, (starting it) Woohoo!
0,season7,714tat30,The Man In The Sportscar, How hot are we? (He drives off.)
0,season7,714tat30,Ross, You wanna buy a car?
0,season7,714tat30,Joey, No.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," Im glad youre here, we have a couple of things to ask you
about the wedding ceremony."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, (starting to cry) Ohh
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Whats the matter? You okay?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Yeah, its just yknow"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the
ceremony."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Oh! I would love to read a poem.
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Do you think you could get through a poem?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, (crying) Itll be a short one.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Ohhh
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Too?
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Do you mind telling us what it is?
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type
manner.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," (entering, excited) Hey!"
0,season7,715jnb,All, Hey!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and"
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, What is DOOL?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," <i>Days Of Our Lives</i>. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My
character is coming out of his coma!!"
0,season7,715jnb,All, Oh!!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Thats great!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," So great things are happening at work and in your personal
life!"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and
when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, What? A brain transplant?!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," (seriously) Yes, its a highly controversial procedure."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Its ridiculous!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three
and a half months."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," (to Monica and Rachel) Its winter, they are fewer people on the
street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Who are they killing off?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Shes my favorite character on DOOL.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Nice.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," She is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, I mean I
dont think Ive ever seen her finish a beverage."
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, And the way she slaps all the time!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Oh!
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," Wouldnt you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards
Chandler.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Dont do it.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh, tell me about it. And shes been on the show forever, its
gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain
transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Yes, but in Drake Ramorays body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is
this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Yeah? Why?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an
attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us
figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Ohh, he left his cell phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and
I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Yeah That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both
get up.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, What? Wait! Whywhy do you get the story?
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," That wasnt a date! That was, that was just friends getting
together(quietly) having sex."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didnt think Id love
again."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Nice try.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, I dont know. 
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Well umm, maybe we could uhh (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! "
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Ah-ha! Too cocky!
0,season7,715jnb,Dina," Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can
do about it!"
0,season7,715jnb,Jessica Lockhart, Oh yes there is!
0,season7,715jnb,Dina, What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
0,season7,715jnb,Jessica Lockhart, (gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.
0,season7,715jnb,Dina," Well, at least Im not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Jessica Lockhart," (crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dinas head
to her other shoulder so that shes the only one in the picture.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do
that?"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Oh, just years of experience."
0,season7,715jnb,Dina, (crying) Can I get some ice here?!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Say what?
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats
not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.
I-Im the guy in the coma!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Oh that was a real person?!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain
when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, I-I-Im leaving the show?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, (quickly) I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Who told you that?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh uh, one of the writers."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Umm
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Okay.
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips
about a character that Ive been playing for 20 yearsIll give you a tip!
(She throws her drink in his face.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Ms. Monroe (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving
Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just
received.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! Okay
look, I have an idea. Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has
on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And
then whoever does gets the phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, I dont think so.
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but Id bet youd
be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is
mom."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last
blueberry muffin."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isnt
telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T
hats a steak house!"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! Hes got <i>Barneys</i>
on his speed dial."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," So you dont know thats <i>Barneys</i> the store! That
can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. Who has <i>Barneys</i> the
store on their speed dial?"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, What is that?
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, I think its the dying cat parade.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, It sounds like its coming from across the street.
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, What?
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was
hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""Youre half
Scottish right?"""
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Nooo!!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Yes!!
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the
window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why
is your family Scottish?!"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Why is your family Ross?!
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come
on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," If you listen very carefully, I think its <i>Celebration</i> by <i>Cool
and the Gang</i>."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, How are ya?
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Good.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I
was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it
rang I could just pick it up?"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Ooh, now you lost me."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, You stole the phone!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, No I didnt!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new
ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebes bag starts to ring.) Oh, it
does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebes handbag.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Phoebe!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, That is a different phone.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guys phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her
phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.
(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) Its for me!"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, That is damning evidence.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Oh my God! I bet thats him. My digital fairy tale is about to
begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be
(Happily) Hi! Its Rach (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachels hand,
catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, Im the one who found your phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Phoebe! You cant do th
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Shhh! Im on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can
pick it up tonight, say 8"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, You just said it!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would justbe alone
yknow to think about my mom and her suicide."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Oh Phoebe!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, What?! Thats the first time today!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Ohh! (Exits.)
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, So you like the nachos uh? Myself Im partial to
0,season7,715jnb,Dina, (interrupting) Im 16.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," (walking up) Youre absolutely right they are writing me out of
the show. They dont know exactly when its going to happen, but apparently
it's going to be very soon and thats it."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Im so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the
show."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Yeah, thanks."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," No I mean it! I cant believe they would do this to you! And to your
fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Oh youre right. Thank you! Whats your name again?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Joey.
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her
drink on a passing writer.)"
0,season7,715jnb,The Writer, It wasnt my decision!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," (to him) Im having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were
saying?"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,
that I came up to you before was because well, Im really nervous about-about being
you. Yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Yknow?
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid
show, but because I owe it to Jessica."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Oh thats great! Oh thank you so much!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Youre so welcome.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this? (In a
British accent.) ""Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again!
Ever!!"""
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Is that supposed to be me?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Yeah.
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Yeah but Jessica doesnt have an English accent.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my
résumé!"
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Well, I feel like a snack!"
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Oh no thanks. I dont like anything from my Scottish
heritage."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, What?!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland
byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its
Scottish roots."
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But
yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous
for? Sitting down and being quiet."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, How did you know about that?!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Were you the ones called the cops?!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler," Thats not really important right now. What is important is;
while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our
wedding."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Why not?
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, Because we hate them.
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!
0,season7,715jnb,Chandler, We have heard you play.
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," No, youve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to
perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And Im not going to tell you what
song Im gonna play either. But uh, lets just say when its over Ill
bet there will be a wee bit o celebration."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when
Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.
(Joey is nodding.) You try."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
All right!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! Hes not
finding it out for the first time! So, try it again."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Right. Hes not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns
it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!
(Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, its a little weird, but its
getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, Im gonna miss this woman so much. I
dont know what Im going to do! I mean, its been 20 years of my life."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh wellHey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.
Yknow? Itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different
characters. Youre so talented."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," I am. I am, but I dont know, you know. An actor of a certain age
is not that easy."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Hey thats not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelina
Jolie!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," I probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were
pouring in, but yknow I just got so comfy here! And Ohh, I turned down some
amazing work!"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Like-like what?
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Well, lets just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of
Mexican cinema would be very different today!"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, (impressed) Wow!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," But Well now, nows a different time for me. (Starts to
cry.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! Umm, look
let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, Im thinking,
""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"" (Shes not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am
also thinking, ""She is hot!"""
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, (intrigued) You think Im hot?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We
should probably get-get uh"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a
man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face. (She does so.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause shes so passionate?"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," No! Its because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her
hands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands
may be a
little off, they should be maybe right like (She grabs the back of his neck and
kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Hey! Hey!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Well why shouldnt I?!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Because its my apartment!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Well, then I get to give him the cell phone."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the
calls to China."
0,season7,715jnb,Tom, Hi!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, (laughs) Youre not the man who left the cell phone.
0,season7,715jnb,Tom, No thats my assistant.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
0,season7,715jnb,Tom," Umm, no."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Could you-could you umm, give us one second?"
0,season7,715jnb,Tom, Sure!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Well be right back sir.
0,season7,715jnb,Tom, Sure.
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Wh-what do we do?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, I dont know!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for
a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Hmm, they just dont make em like that anymore!"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to
wait."
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe," Rachel, listenI mean, if you let me have him then I will really
owe you one."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have
him, but you owe me; you owe me big!"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Yeah! Youre such a great friend!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Ohh
0,season7,715jnb,Tom," So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?"
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Oh thatd be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
0,season7,715jnb,Tom, Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, (whispering) Nice!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Well, you certainly own that room."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Hi.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am
such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Well, its nice to know that you"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monicas.)
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Oh that explains all the womens underwear.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! Its true!! Oh my God you are so
amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Certainly.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to
her cheek.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Id love to, but my lawyer said I cant do that anymore."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," God. You seem really, really nice."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Okay, bye-bye."
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the
apartment.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica," (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To
Cecilia) Umm, youre a stupid bitch."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, I really cant slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, You are so beautiful.
0,season7,715jnb,Monica, Nice to meet you! My God youre great!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To
Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. Im used to it, dont worry
about it."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, What?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, They sent me todays script! They never send the script!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, They dont?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Well no, Im just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes
what that means.) Oh"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, How does it happen?
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an
electric fence."
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Yeah well, Im guessing after this shes not going to be crazy
about electricity either."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel," (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee
socks."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
0,season7,715jnb,Rachel, No!
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," (stands up) Now umm, remember Im still learning."
0,season7,715jnb,Ross," One, two, three, four!"
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, So?
0,season7,715jnb,Dina," Loosening the saddle on mothers horse was brilliant Fredrick. And
the electric fence, inspired."
0,season7,715jnb,Dina," I cant believe shes really gone. Look around you, all of this
is ours. (They move into a kiss but; theyre stopped by Joey entering with a huge
bandage wrapped around his head.)"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, (as Jessica) I dont think so.
0,season7,715jnb,Dina, Who are you?!
0,season7,715jnb,Jessica Lockhart," Whats the matter Dina? Dont you recognize your own
(Does a hair flip) mother?!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," (running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think
that youre a better Jessica than I ever was!"
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Oh noo
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Well of course not, but you were very good."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Thanks!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, A film in Guadalajara!
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, The airport?
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, No thats La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, Eight months.
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Thats a really long time.
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few
places down there."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey," Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant againThat isI tell ya, that is a
tricky one!"
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia," That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. Youve,
well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful."
0,season7,715jnb,Joey, Good luck.
0,season7,715jnb,Cecilia, You too.
0,season7,715jnb,Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
0,season7,715jnb,Phoebe, Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! 
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Hi.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Hi! Hi Ben!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Hi.
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Oh, yeah go ahead."
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joeys special romance magazines in
there?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, No. No.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, (to Ben) Okay! All clear!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, (running to the bathroom) Thanks Phoebe!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Ben, it's Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever."
0,season7,716tal,Ross, (to Ben) Everything okay in there?
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Dont talk to me now!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Awww, just like his daddy."
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The deans office just called
and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, What-what about Monica?
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Oh, she isnt home."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, (nervous) So it would just be me alone?
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Well, Ben would be there."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Huh umm
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Whats the matter?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Well thatyknow its just uh, Ive never done that
before. Me and him alone."
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Rach, hes not an ex-con."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?"
0,season7,716tal,Ross, I dont know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, Im gonna leave you
here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Yeah I think so.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, (To Rachel) I wasnt talking to you.
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Ill be okay.
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Okay, Ill see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in
an hour."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Bye dad.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh (Silence) So this is fun, huh?"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Not really.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Okay.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Uh great! How do you feel about <i>Diet Coke</i>?
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Im not allowed to have soda.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Okay. Well thats pretty much all that we haveOh! Oh! Have
you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Whats a virgin?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Water it is.
0,season7,716tal,Monica, What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, You mean the spitter?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Come on! It wasnt that bad!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
0,season7,716tal,Monica," All right, what about the third guy?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Can you blame him?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say ""I
do,"" hes thinking, ""Yeah, Id do her too!"""
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Well then we still have a problem.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yeah!
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, (returning with Joey) With what?
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and
theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the
ladies. (Points to her chest.)"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Oo! You should have one of us do it!
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Phoebe, were getting married, married; not sixth grade
married."
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on
the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Are you serious?
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
0,season7,716tal,Joey, I call it!!
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, What?! No! It was my idea!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say
legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Ben yknow when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang
out all the time. Cause I was, I was your daddys girlfriend."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, But youre not anymore!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," No, Im not."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Cause you guys were on a break.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Hey! We were not on aOkay. Thats fine! Fine.
Yknow what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire
story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Whens my daddy coming back?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and
sisters, huh? That must be nice. You dont have to share stuff."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Sharing is good.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Oh, youre one of those. But yknow what? I have two
sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Really? Like how?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,
wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so
theyd put salt on their cereal."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, (laughs) Thats a good one.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Yeah? You like that one?
0,season7,716tal,Ben," Yeah, youre funny."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Im funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!
Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one? Heres a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a
quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say
to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without
it leaving your face. And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil
line right down the center of their face."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Can I do it to you?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were
still together."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Were never gonna find anybody.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Well then let me do it!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Joe
0,season7,716tal,Joey," No-no-no! Look, Ive been thinking about it. Im an actor right?
So I wont get nervous talking in front of people."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Joey look its really sweet
0,season7,716tal,Joey," No-no-no-no look no! I wont spit, and I wont stare at
Monicas breasts! Yknow? Everyone knows Im an ass man!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, That is true.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like,
stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a
really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to
me."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," (To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, It might be kinda cool.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, So I can do it?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yeah you can do it.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my
speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Okay.
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Hey Pheebs, hows it going?"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Oh, Im sorry. Can I get you something?"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh my God, youve got to stop chattering!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, What is it?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Its Hexadrin.
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh no, I dont believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply
pressure to these points right here. (Shes pinching the bit of skin between her
right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you
still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Okay, while were waiting for these pills to kick in, Im
gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some
nice soft pillows under your head, Im gonna turn the TV on and you can watch
whatever you want. And ImSit down(She sits down on the couch)gonna
make you some tea. And then, Im gonna rub your feet."
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Oh.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Oh! My head! Oh! (Hes sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his
feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Coming. 
0,season7,716tal,Ross, I have a bone to pick with you.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Uh-oh.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Oh yeah? Did he pull the old (She is waving her hand up and down
her face. Shes thinking about the pencil mark.)"
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Thats right! Thats right! <i>Saran Wrap</i> on the toilet seat
so the pee goes everywhere!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Oh that.
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and
theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Oh, come on! <i>Saran Wrap</i> on the toilet seat, you dont think
thats just a little funny?!"
0,season7,716tal,Ross," I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught
him right?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, (looking at his mark) Yes.
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Its amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills
called?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a
story! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff."
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Say what?
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Yknow, the possible side effects."
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,
facial swelling, nausea, headacheHeadache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!
Now okay, I dont recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death
capsules! Oh Im sorry, extra strength death capsules!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there
for legal reasons!"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Why?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, In case it happens.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing
the proof of his ordination.)"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, You did it! You got ordained?!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Our minister
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her
torso.)"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Okay, then I must be disoriented."
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony,
do you wanna hear it?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Yeah!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the
piece of paper he brought.) ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to
celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" (Monica and Chandler like
it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) ""It is a love based on giving and receiving.
As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and
received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" (Phoebe nods
her approval.) ""We too can share and love and have and receive."""
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
0,season7,716tal,Carol," Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the
quarter trick with her as well.)"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,716tal,Carol, What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Well yknow I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your
building and I thought to myself, ""Whats up with Carol and sweet, little
Ben?"""
0,season7,716tal,Carol, Can I ask whatCome on in.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,716tal,Carol," Umm uh, Ill make some coffee and we can uh, chat."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Id love that. I would loooove (Carol goes to make the coffee
and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little..."
0,season7,716tal,Ben, (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the
coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why Ive come here to talk to you
okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Carol," (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Yes oh(To Ben)Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)
No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that
stuff I taught you yesterday?"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Dont do that.
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Dont do that.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Seriously, your dad doesnt like pranks."
0,season7,716tal,Ben," Seriously, your dad doesnt like pranks."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Oh damnit!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Oh damnit!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, No! Dont say that! Dont say that!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Damnit!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, No dont! Go back to repeating!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Damnit!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Oh crap!
0,season7,716tal,Ben, Oh crap!
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to
happen to you! Stop being such a baby!"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
(Holds up the warning label.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yeah. O-okay.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," (reading) ""When I think of the love that these two givers and
receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and
giving and"" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (He
points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, How about receiving?
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Yes!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things
about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!
Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so
hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole
anything?"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the
eyes?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, It doesnt say that!
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic
stories. Nice stories."
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe Ill talk about London! Yknow
when you two hooked up! Only, only I wont say hooked up. Ill say, ""Began
their beautiful journey"""
0,season7,716tal,Monica, There you go!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," ""by doin it."""
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Joe?
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet
across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together
and shes feeding you strawberries?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Isnt that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Yeah!! I call that London style.
0,season7,716tal,Monica," No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad
that night because this guy thought that I was Rosss mom."
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Oh.
0,season7,716tal,Monica," And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we
drank too much"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Yeah baby!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and
said goodnight."
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Oh.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, But then later that night
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Yeah baby!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, (answering the door) Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Monica," (standing outside) Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up
here in London huh?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Well I was I wasn't exactly expecting company after(He looks
at his watch.) 9"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, (entering) Is Joey here?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the
bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about
what that guy told ya are ya?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Wouldnt you be?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and
youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I
mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Really?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going
on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Well, not anymore."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, But we dont do that.
0,season7,716tal,Monica," I know, I just thought it would be fun."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, How drunk are you?
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you
should feel guilty about taking advantage."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, (thinks) Thats the perfect amount!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Okay!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, (breaking the kiss) Yknow whats weird?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, What?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, This doesnt feel weird!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, I know.
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Youre a really good kisser.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna
get under the covers?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Hm-hmm!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Okay!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Were gonna see each other naked.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yep!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Count of three?
0,season7,716tal,Monica, One!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Two!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Two!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively
ruined."
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Eh, we werent that close anyway!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Eh!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV is
turned off.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Oh, dude Im so sorry!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, No! No! No!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Hey no-no-no-no! Its cool! Its cool! I-Ill only be a
second, Im still with my bridesmaid, I justWhere are those condoms you
brought?"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Theyre in my bag over there. (Points.)
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Ah. (Joey walks to Chandlers bag by getting as far away from
Chandlers bed as possible.)"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Uh, could you leave me one?"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, (pause) For just you?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Yeah.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Hey listen, why dont you come downstairs with me? Theres some
really nice girls down there."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, No I-I-Im fine.
0,season7,716tal,Joey," All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Thats what that was?! Cause that other thing? I thought you
were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Okay, can we change the topic? Because its really doing
nothing for me."
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Oh (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadnt left you that last
one? You two mightve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent
that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! Its like it was in the stars!"
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Yeah, its totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you
originally wanted to hook up with that night."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, What?!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, What?
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, (To Joey) What?!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Who did you originally want to hook up with?
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Okay, fine but please dont be upset! Okay? I was really
depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just
wantedjust sex. So, when Iwent to your room that nightI was actually
lookingfor Joey. (Joey smiles.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever
in-intend on telling me about this?"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," No, because it-it didnt seem important."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If it
wasnt for a bridesmaid youd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It
is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv(Shuts
up on Monicas glare.)"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," I dont believe it. The most romantic night of my life and
Im runner up."
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was
not there that night?!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now Im a man of the cloth, but
I still have feelings!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," (To Joey) Look there is no way youre doing this wedding now.
Okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," What?! Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my
bridesmaid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?! (To Monica) I
mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of
this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standing
their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needI
dont know what I need. I need a walk."
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Wait Chandler come on, letsits not a big deal!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," It is to me. You wanted to sleep with <i>Batman</i>, and instead you
had to settle for <i>Robin</i>. (Walks out and slams the door.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, This is crazy.
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe, I know! <i>Robin</i> is so gay!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, So now what have we agreed?
0,season7,716tal,Ben, No more pranks.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, And-and what else?
0,season7,716tal,Ben, That you and daddy were not on a break.
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Very good.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Rachel! What are you doing here?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Im just visiting my good friend Carol.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Your good friend?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Whats her last name?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, CarolLesbian?
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, What line?
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class
of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) ""Dude, dont you ever wash
your face?"""
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," All right, Im sorry. Im sorry I didnt tell you but you
were so mad already!"
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-its
not funny!"
0,season7,716tal,Carol, (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Hi.
0,season7,716tal,Carol, Whats not funny?
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Practical jokes.
0,season7,716tal,Carol, Oh II think theyre funny.
0,season7,716tal,Ross, You have a line down your face.
0,season7,716tal,Carol, What? (Goes and checks.)
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Okay, maybe they are not funny to you"
0,season7,716tal,Carol, (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Or Carol! But theyre funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Uh, yknow what? Ill tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office
wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really
just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!"""
0,season7,716tal,Ross," I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff
anymore. Okay?"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Fine. Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that
stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go
back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!"
0,season7,716tal,Ross," No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding
but I"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna
have to teach him this stuff! And I havent taught him anything that a normal
6-year-old doesnt know anyway!"
0,season7,716tal,Ben, (yelling from off camera) Crap!!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, I gotta go! (Runs out.)
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but
it would probably rather sleep with you!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," No-hey-no! If you dont want me to do it, I accept that. I dont
care about that. I justI dont want you to be upset."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this
fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the
rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!
Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys
are perfect for each other. Yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it
justit-it fits. Yknow? And you just know its gonna last forever."
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Thats what you should say.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, What?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, When youre marrying us; thats what you should say.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Really? I can do it?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, Id love it if you would do it.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Hey! (They hug.)
0,season7,716tal,Chandler, But those are the words! Those exact words!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Well I dont know if I remember exactly but, its-its pretty
much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
0,season7,716tal,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Hey Im sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you
can look after Ben for a little bit? I-Ive got this meeting at school. And-and he-he
asked for his uh, Fun Aunt Rachel, so"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, dont we Ben?
(He nods yes.)"
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Okay, Ill see you later pal."
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads Poop.)
WhAh-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I cant do it."
0,season7,716tal,Ross, What?
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," I cant let him go out that way, hes got a meeting. (To Ross)
Youve got something here on your back."
0,season7,716tal,Ross," What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) Thats great.
That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just
finish talking about Ben?!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, Oh I
0,season7,716tal,Ben, What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
0,season7,716tal,Ross," All right, thats it! (He runs over to Ben, who runs past him and
out the door.) Comeyouno! You are in big trouble young man!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, No! Wait! Come on!
0,season7,716tal,Ross," Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel, No you guys (She walks out into the hallway.)
0,season7,716tal,Ross," I-I-am(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the
stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)"
0,season7,716tal,Rachel," EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to
him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Hey-hey.
0,season7,716tal,Joey, So are guys doing okay?
0,season7,716tal,Chandler," Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little
bit and some things in life are more important."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what
would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up."
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Honey! Dinners ready!
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Your favorite!
0,season7,716tal,Joey," Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!"
0,season7,716tal,Monica, Yep! And lots of it!
0,season7,716tal,Monica," Okay, in we go."
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Here you go.
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks
her watch) Thats it! Im out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!"
0,season7,716tal,Joey, Good for you!
0,season7,716tal,Phoebe," Oh, its like a huge weight has been lifted! Cause look, (reads
the side effects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, Im just so happy! Because no
shortness of breath, no temporary euphoriaOh."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have
to narrow it down to six."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings
that were trying to get to play at the wedding?"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, Since when are you into swing music?
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Chandler.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, <i>Gap</i> commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, I will.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Do you want me to call?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," No, Ill do it. You just stick to your job."
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, What is your job?
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Staying out of the way.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," This is impossible Monica, why dont you just pick all 15? (Hands
back the paper.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, There were only twelve.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh yeah, I added three."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, What are peanut butter fingers?!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh yeah (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter,
scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello!
Shes cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged.
Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)
(Calmly) So hi, Im uh, Im Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly
waves.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, cause if you
areId love to show you around sometime."
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," II uh, actually just moved from four blocks over."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Ah.
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, But-but this block is like a whole other world.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Yknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this
street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen
crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the
street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what hes talking
about.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, (To Ross) Smooth.
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, (To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Umm, say youre gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you
say I take you to dinner tonight?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Oh Id like that.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Yeah?
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Yeah.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box hes holding.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, After you.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When
shes gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler cant pick it up.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I cant believe I found it!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Well Im Monica Geller, ball like a baby."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Have you found your dress yet?
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could
afford one."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," No, I cant afford this either. No. I-I-Im, Im just
here to
figure out which one I want then Im gonna get it at Kleinmans, this discount
place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale."
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," Oh, thanks for the tip."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," Oh Im not, I just like to try these on."
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, I do the same thing.
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25<sup>th</sup>.
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," Im just kidding too. (Laughs) Im getting married in
December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, (To Monica) So when are you getting married?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Oh May 15<sup>th</sup>.
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, Oooh its getting close!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Yeah!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," So uh, whos your photographer?"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Jeffery.
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, The best man? Wow!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings."
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. "
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God!
It doesnt matter; theyre both great!"
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," Oh yknow what? Yknow what? Now that you know what you want
you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off. This place is so overpriced."
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," So, does this (the dress) come in another color or (The store
owner walks away.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin in or movin out?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Im moving in.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh uh, can I give you a hand?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me
before had to leave because he hurt his back."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Boyfriend?
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, No.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Im Joey. (They shake hands.)
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Kristen.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Kristen.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," So uh, do you live around here?"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a
little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your
shoes gone."
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Ill remember that.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me
tonight?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," Oh I, I have plans tonight. "
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Oh.
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, But how about tomorrow?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? (The lamp hes
holding.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the
boxes."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but
decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, Ill grab this one. (He
follows her upstairs.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so
when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what youre looking for! (Holds up
a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She
passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running."
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, Got it.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, All right.
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Oh theyre pushing! Theyre pushing!!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, (To Rachel) Hey! Dont be a baby!
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Well I
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman
tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Dont crowd me! (Finds it) This is it!
This is the dress! Oh my God, its perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone
has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) Im sorry, this
ones taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Megan!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, Monica!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, You came?!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, Yeah!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, This is my dress!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, No!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
0,season7,717cwd,Megan, And now youll see me buying it.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," What? You freak! You wouldnt even have known about this place if
it wasnt for me!"
0,season7,717cwd,Megan," Look, you dont want to fight me."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Maybe I do! Im pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," (hearing the signal) Im coming! Im coming! (She takes off
towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the
other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and
finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the
way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What
are you doing? (Rachel doesnt stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel wont stop
so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, Did you find the dress?
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are
crazy!"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, IWe gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, No! You gotta hold my hand!!
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachels hand and drags her towards Monica.)
Excuse me! Excuse me! (Shes knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) "
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, (seeing whos trapped) Hey
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the
magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying
shed like to go out again."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Huh.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Yeah in fact, Im gonna go call her right now. And Ill make
sure to tell her my friend Chandler says (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, (entering) Hey Chandler!
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you
dont come by? Thats okay!"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right
across the street!"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Really? Right across the street?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Yeah!
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Whend you meet her?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Two days ago.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Oh yeah?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, (returning) Hey.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Hi! Howd it go?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Oh great! Were going out again Saturday. But I just found shes
also seeing some other guy."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in
Rosss situation?"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, Im dating this girl whos also
seeing another guy. But, I dont know, Im not too worried about it."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Well you shouldnt be. Believe me I wouldnt want to be the guy
whos up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But
unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,
whats the name of the girl youre dating?"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Bye! (Exits.)
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should
date her"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or Im the one who dates
her."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Yeah well we should order some food then.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay?
Hey-hey, well each go out with her one more time. And-and well see who
she likes best."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, (smiling) That sounds fair.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the
street"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Ah yeahwait a second now! Look were gonna have to set a
spending limit on the date. I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like
that."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Well sorry, thats what I do on dates."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, So lets decide on the spending limit
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Yeah. Uh, (thinks)a slice(Thinks)six dollars?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, I was thinking more like a hundred.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Oh
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Youre out of <i>Diet Coke</i>.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen
here missy! (Listens) Wh(She is hung up on.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, What?!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our
wedding and said that I couldnt have them back unless I gave her the dress!"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress!
WhChandler wants the band. What do I do?"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe, Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, How?
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Youre out of toilet paper!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Hey! Whats up?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," I just wanted to come by and yknow, wish you good luck on your date."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Oh thanks!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, We have 8
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Wow, thats in like 20 minutes. Youd better get dressed."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, I am dressed.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is
this? Did you give yourself a facial?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, I have an oily T-zone!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Okay dude! (Finds a receipt.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Thats right.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So
technically, technically
I didnt break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the
rules too yknow!"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, I dont know.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Why am I not surprised?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, I dont think you have much choice.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Well well see!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Bye-bye!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So
just a light layer?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and
there (Runs his fingers across his forehead)."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom
to wash his hands.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," Yeah, swing music is so out."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, (returning) What are you guys talking about?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the Swing Kings
and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go."
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two
months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any
connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, But I love swing music!
0,season7,717cwd,Phoebe," Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that people
actually die at their concertsThey just stop living."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And
theres another reason too."
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel," Well, what is the other reason?"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, I dont want to say.
0,season7,717cwd,Rachel, Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it
wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my
dances with."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Oh crap!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Oh great!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Yeah.
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Is your back feeling better?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Oh yeah its fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they
can spasm out of control."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, (entering) Kristen?
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Joey!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Hi!
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Hi! What are you doing here?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Oh I like this place. And technically, technically Im not breaking
any rules so I"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Hi!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Hi. (They shake hands.) Its nice to meet you. I used to have a
friend named Joey. I dont anymore."
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Yeah. So
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," Well Joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the
stars of <i>Days Of Our Lives</i>."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Thats right! Thats right, dont you play a woman?"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, A woman in a mans body.
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Much better.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," So yknow Ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me
too. Have you ever been married?"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were
talking about how Ive been married and how I have a son."
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen," Yeah, little Eric."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Thats right! Wait no, Ben."
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, So youve just married the one time then?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Well umm
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Youve been married twice?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Yes. And another time after that. Boy Im getting hungry! Hey Joey,
have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you
ate some
of her food?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first
marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?"
0,season7,717cwd,Kristen, Do you two know each other?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman
on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge."
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, Monkey lover!
0,season7,717cwd,Joey, When do you think we lost her?
0,season7,717cwd,Ross, Probably around gonorrhea.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Hi, honey! Im home!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, (from the bedroom) Dont come in here!
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, No! We only mess around at his place!
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Yknow its funny I started it but, now its
scaring me.
So could you come out here please?"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," No, Im wearing a wedding dress."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Oh you got a wedding dress? Thats great!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Yeah but Im not keeping it.
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Well then why cant I see it?
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you cant
like it."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Okay I promise. Ill-Ill hate it. (She enters.) Wow!
You-you lookhideous."
0,season7,717cwd,Monica, Really?
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress Ive ever seen.
Wh-why do you have to return it?"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Oh because it doesntreally fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked
the Swing Kings."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler," Oh thats great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean its
like yuck! Its terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Okay! But you cant rip it. Well, maybe a little."
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, Okay!
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?
(They ignore her.) Guys?"
0,season7,717cwd,Chandler, (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
0,season7,717cwd,Monica,"  Alright, whats going on?"
0,season7,717cwd,Monica," Im sorry. Im sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls
alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)"
0,season7,717cwd,Ross," Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes were gonna have younger
looking skin!"
0,season7,717cwd,Joey," Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Yknow, she could use a
little(Whistles that she needs to do what theyre doing.) (Something happens on
the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Hey! You guys! Youre not gonna believe this! I just got off the
phone with my agent"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) Im sorry, too soon. You go."
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Okay. I got nominated for my part on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Joey!
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Good for you!
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Congratulations! Wow! I cant believe youre nominated for an <i>Emmy</i>!

0,season7,718towja,Joey, No! Im up for a Soapie!
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Honey? Is that something youre making up?
0,season7,718towja,Joey," No, no, no! Its real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns
from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! Im up for a Soapie!"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious
soap opera award there is!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who Im taking to the awards.
(Points to Rachel.)"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Oh, stop that! Dont kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be
there?"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Many are scheduled to appear.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God! I cant go! Im gonna be too nervous!
0,season7,718towja,Monica," (to Joey) Okay, Ill go!"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.

0,season7,718towja,Lewis, What kinda noise?
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, But like how?
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Well we-we dont know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded
something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesnt know what to
make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, thats uh, thats all for
today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? "
0,season7,718towja,Morse, Yes sir.
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, Im afraid
I-I had to fail you."
0,season7,718towja,Morse, (shocked) Why?!
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Well you need 60% to pass
0,season7,718towja,Morse, Whatd I get?
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Seven.
0,season7,718towja,Morse, Thats not so good.
0,season7,718towja,Ross, No-no its not. What-what happened there Ned?
0,season7,718towja,Morse, Well maybe you can cut me some slack. Im sort of in love.
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Well Im sorry but, that-thats really not my problem."
0,season7,718towja,Morse, Im in love with you.
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Well that brings me in the loop a little.
0,season7,718towja,Morse," You see, thats why I did so bad on this test. Im having a
hard time concentrating. When youre up there (Points to the podium) and youre
teaching and your face gets all seriousyou look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wear
that tight little turtleneck sweater"
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, Im your teacher. Im
sorry, youre-youre a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be
written on the backs of some of these chairs."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Really? (Looks.) My God, hes really cute."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Go for it.
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Phoebe, Im engaged!"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Im just saying, get his number just in case. But no"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im
engaged. (Points to her ring.)"
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," I did, but that was really fun."
0,season7,718towja,Joey," (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner isJoey Tribbiani! (He
then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a
bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I
didnt prepare a speech. But umm, Id like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my
parents, whove always been there for me. Id also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Im fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple
syrup award!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Yeah may-maybe you dont tell anyone about this.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," What? No! Its not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo
bottle."
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Really?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, What award are you practicing for?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," <i>Grammy</i>, Best New Artist."
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Oh, hey listen! The Soapies called today, and I also get to present
an award."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Ohh thats great!
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Yeah!
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," So youll definitely get onstage, even if you dont win."
0,season7,718towja,Joey, (confused) What you-you dont think Im gonna win?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Well of course I do! But yknow, favorite returning character is a
tough category Joey. I mean youre up against the guy who survived his own cremation."
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but its justIve
never even been nominated before! I want it so much."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Well Joey, youll probably get it. But you should probably
start practicing your gracious loser face. Yknow when like the cameras are on you and you wanna
look disappointed, but also that your colleague deserved to win. Yknow? So its
sorta like (Does it, youll have to see it.)"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Hey! (Likes it.)
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Yknow?
0,season7,718towja,Joey, You practice losing the <i>Grammies</i> too?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Oh no, at the <i>Grammies</i> I always win."
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Ah.
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Oh hey!
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Hey! Howd your date go with Jake?
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Oh, great! We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and
then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and
touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," (laughs) All I could think of was yknow, ""Is he gonna kiss
me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
0,season7,718towja,Monica, And did he?
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey
speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks
today and Ive only had six."
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with
Chandler. Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, You sound like a guy.
0,season7,718towja,Monica," No, a guy would be saying, ""Im never gonna get to sleep with
anyone else."" Oh my God! Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that
Id be giving up! I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Youll have a last kiss.
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Whoa!
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, (entering from her room) Whoa what?
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Ross has a boyfriend.
0,season7,718towja,Ross," I do-I do not have a boyfriend. Theres a guy in one of my
classes who-who has a crush on me."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Really?
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Yeah! I dont know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe? (Rachel
and Joey both look at him.)"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Not right now.
0,season7,718towja,Ross, It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and
it was so hard! Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time
he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in
love."
0,season7,718towja,Ross, Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Howd you get over that teacher?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, I didnt. I got under him.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, (To Ross) Problem solved.
0,season7,718towja,Jake, Bye Phoebe.
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Okay bye. (They kiss.)
0,season7,718towja,Jake, All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye
at the door so as not to flaunt our new love."
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Phoebe, its okay. You dont have to tip toe around me.
I-Ive been thinking about it and umm, yknow what? Im okay about not
having that new relationship feeling"
0,season7,718towja,Jake, (yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
0,season7,718towja,Monica," See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But
I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for
the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey
sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our
relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, dont you think?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler, Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Yeah, I got my speech!"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Do you got your gracious loser face?
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Yeah. (Does it.)
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, On TV?! Yeah!
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Kay! 
0,season7,718towja,The Presenter," in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the
nominees are"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which
is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that hes on TV
right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for
this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head
in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Rach, we had to get out of there because"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Oh my God, you stole her award!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," No-no! No, Im accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the
TV to display it.)"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Joey I dont think you know what behalf means.
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Sure I do! Its a verb! As in, ""I behalfin it!"""
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Joey, you have got to take this back!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," But why?! I shouldve won one and I really want it, and she
didnt even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a <i>Grammy</i>."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, (looking at the award) No! Joey!
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of
em."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Do you really want an award you didnt win?
0,season7,718towja,Joey," No! I want an award I did win! But nobodys giving me any of those!
PlusHey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come
over theyll see it and theyll think I won it."
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress!"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, I can scratch that right off.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Joey, no"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, All right!
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Ill take it back tomorrow.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Thank you.
0,season7,718towja,Joey," (opening his door) If I cant have it you cant have it! (Rachel
walks away angrily.)"
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, Professor Geller?
0,season7,718towja,Ross," (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
0,season7,718towja,Lewis," I know I didnt do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda
hoping you could change my grade."
0,season7,718towja,Ross, And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, Because Im in love with you.
0,season7,718towja,Ross, (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
0,season7,718towja,Lewis," Yeah, Im allin love with you and stuff. So could you change
my grade?"
0,season7,718towja,Ross, No!
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, Well why not? You changed Neds grade!
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Well thats different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with
me!"
0,season7,718towja,Lewis," No hes not! Hes totally yanking your chain! Hes done
this with three other teachers!"
0,season7,718towja,Ross, What?
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, Hes got a girlfriend!
0,season7,718towja,Ross, I cant believe someone would do that for a grade.
0,season7,718towja,Lewis, I know! Its awful. I love you.
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Have you seen Chandler?
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, No. Why?
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Cause I just keep thinking about all these things that Im
not gonna have, and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do about it."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Okay, dont sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere
around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guys cute. (Points to a guy
sitting behind Monica.)"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Phoebe! Come on, Im serious! I just got to talk to him about all
this."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," No, that is the last thing you want to do!"
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Why?
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Because youre marrying him!
0,season7,718towja,Monica, You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," All right, Ive never been engaged and Ive never really been
married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband."
0,season7,718towja,Monica," So Im not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy
Im gonna spend the rest of my life with?"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," That is correct! Yes, youre supposed to take all of that stuff and
put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Your mother told you this?
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Yes!
0,season7,718towja,Monica," The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you
were 13?"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Oh my God! Youre right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell
Chandler! Hurry before its too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean
putting out doesnt get you love? (Monica is shocked.)"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, I cannot believe Im gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Okay, Im totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)"
0,season7,718towja,Jessica Ashley, Come in.
0,season7,718towja,Joey, Hey Jessica.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, (coolly) Hey Jess.
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Ah, this is my friend Rachel."
0,season7,718towja,Jessica Ashley, Hi.
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Sup? (Joey glares at her.)
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Uh listen, heres your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to
her.)"
0,season7,718towja,Jessica Ashley," (shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this
means?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)"
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Well, that-that-thats it? Youre gonna, youre gonna put
it on your shelf or anything?"
0,season7,718towja,Jessica Ashley," No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if youll
excuse me. (She exits.)"
0,season7,718towja,Joey, (To Rachel) Take it back?
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Absolutely.
0,season7,718towja,Joey," Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with
flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would
like to talk about or share?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler," Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at
all?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler, Kinda. Theyre really big.
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never
gonna be with anybody new again?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler, What?
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Just, I love you so much. JustIts just sometimes it bothers
me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the
first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler," No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly
panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that
youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler, Sleeping with somebody new
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Even with me?
0,season7,718towja,Chandler," I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our
relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be
together for the rest of our lives."
0,season7,718towja,Monica, Really?
0,season7,718towja,Chandler," Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts,
Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports
drink."
0,season7,718towja,Monica," Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you dont have to worry.
No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first
time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid"
0,season7,718towja,Chandler, (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?"
0,season7,718towja,Morse," (walking up) That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair
cut?"
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to
know that Im changing your grade back."
0,season7,718towja,Morse, What?! Why?
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Cause I know what youre trying to pull here. Okay? Its
not gonna work."
0,season7,718towja,Morse," Im not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you dude."
0,season7,718towja,Ross," Yknow what? I-Im not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This
little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay(Ned looks
shocked)Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me
feel, Ned?! You used me! You dont love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to
make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor
Fredrickson, Ill be right with you. (To Ned) Dont make this worse and
Ill give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, Rach? 
0,season7,718towja,Rachel, Ill be out in a second.
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Oh. (Picks it up.) Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy
Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a<i> Nobel Prize</i>
and yknow to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a <i>Tony</i>
award for best actress in"
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," (entering from her room) Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at
8"
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe, in Reservations at 8
0,season7,718towja,Rachel," Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta
go."
0,season7,718towja,Phoebe," Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW
YORK! ITS SATURDAY NIGHT!!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Im sorry, do I know you?"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, What are you doing?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Nothing, Im just practicing blowing you off because Im gonna
be a big movie star!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Oh! You got it?!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey,"  Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, What was it for?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian
brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. Its really classy! Oh,
and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, The next next?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Yeah, theres this guy from Chicago whos supposed to be the
next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guys right after him. (Joeys
cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, (on phone) Oh my God!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Whats the matter?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Wow!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, I know! My grandmothers gonna see this!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Grandmas gonna have to get in line.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Yeah. But a part of me also cant wait til its over.
Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman
in America."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand? "
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Sure.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is
coming to stay with us for a few days."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, Cassie?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Uh-hmm.
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Wow, I havent seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still
carries that <i>Barbie</i> everywhere she goes."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Ross, shes 25 years old."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, So what! I still haveNo youre probably right.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Subtle guys!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, What?!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, I know youre planning my surprise bridal shower.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," (laughs) Well okayWell dont ruin it! Just play along at
least!"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," I dont know! Its not like its porn! This is a serious,
legitimate movie. Yknow? And the nudity is really important to the story."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Thats what you say about porn.
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the
chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Well thats true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds
really great. My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who
run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and
undress each other and hold each other. Its really sweet and-and tender."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Plus, everyones gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Well, when can we have this shower?"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have
Friday"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Well thats only two days away. What is the other option?
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Yesterday!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! Were done!"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We cant do this by Friday!
We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! Theres just
too much to do! Its impossible! We cant do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do
it!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Rachel, calm down!"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," (calmly) Okay. Im sorry. Youre right, youre right."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Phoebe, I already, I already did."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get
organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast
decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Uh, here. What time?"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, 4 oclock. Food?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Finger sandwiches and tea.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Ooh great! Very Monica.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, And chili!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Both!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Were paying for this yknow.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Neither.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Lusts of the flesh.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, (pause) What?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, I dont know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Oh boy, me too!"
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we
broke up for a few hours"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Yeah?
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and
domineering?!"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler, Thats me! Come on!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Okay. (They both jump up to head for their room, but Monica stops.) But
wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have
lunch."
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler, (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Nice to meet you too.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," So, are you ready to go?"
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Yeah.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, (catching him) Chandler!
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler, Ill be right with you.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, Whatwhy?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Because Purvy Perverson over here cant stop staring at her.
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," What?! Chandler, shes our cousin!"
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.)
Say something."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, You were staring about eight inches south of there.
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even
look like now."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
0,season7,719rmac,Chandler," Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Wafer thin ice!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Hey, Im back!"
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director, Hi-hi Joey.
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Actually, I tried to call you. You didnt need to
come down here today."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Oh great! Yknow I wouldve been perfect for this part, but
whatever! Yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
(Starts to leave.)"
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Wait Joey! You didnt need to come down because the
director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," And scene! Huh? Wasnt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!
Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?"
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Well, the director thinks youre really right for the
part and wants to meet you tomorrow."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Wow! Sure! Thats great!
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Oh, and your agent said you were okay with the nudity."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn
is not too cold."
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Terrific! Well uh, theres one more thing. Uhh, uh
its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.
Yeah, and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how shes never seen a
naked man who wasnt Jewish. So (Laughs.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, SoWhat?
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," So uh well, the director is insisting that whoever play
that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what Im saying?"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Yes!
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director, Okay.
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, No. What?
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not
be"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey,  Barmitsvahed?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, So to get this part you cant be?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Nope.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, But you are?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Yep.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, But you told them you werent?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Thats right.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing there
to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," I dont know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter
what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,
you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning
togrow a turtleneck!"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet
the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," I just have to call my agent and tell her I cant do the part. (Gets
up for the phone.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Unless!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Unless what?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Like what?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Well Im not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head Im
thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Hey! Ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is
everyones individual birth stone."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party
is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know thats coming? Me. Are you?"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Hey! Whats up Mon?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Well uh, Im trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I
raid your fridge?"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Have at it.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that wont work.
Cheese? (Picks it up) That wont work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that
wont work."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Are you makin him a sandwich?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," No its umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, Im gonna go guys. "
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
(Runs out.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," (To Phoebe, after Monicas gone) We have to get her a present?!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Okay but look! Look at what I got! Its her address book! (Holds it
up.) We have a guest list!"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Oh my God youre amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Hey Ross!
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," (hugs him) Its been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting
up your tent in line to see <i>Return of the Jedi</i>."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Oh. Oh, thats right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed
like you didnt."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," Ah yeah, sorry about that."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Its okay. Come, come on in."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice,
but her fiancée sure stares a lot."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, Oh.
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, YeahNo!!
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Im all done.
0,season7,719rmac,Ross, (quietly) Thank God.
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented
that beach house together."
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and
tickled you til you cried? (She laughs) Were probably too old to do that now."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all
of these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill
always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related."
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie," It took you that long to figure it out, huh?"
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," Well Im, Im a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children
would be."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Hi!
0,season7,719rmac,Woman, Hi!
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of
women.) Hi, thanks for coming."
0,season7,719rmac,Woman, Oh thank you.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to
another pairing.) Oh, its so nice to see you."
0,season7,719rmac,Woman, No.
0,season7,719rmac,The Other Woman, No thanks.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Who the hell are all these people?
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Well, I dont know. I called all the people in Monicas phone
book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Hmm, yknow theres another word for people like
that"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," (to her) Hi! Im Rachel. This is Phoebe. Im the maid of
honor. How do you know Monica?"
0,season7,719rmac,Woman, I was her accountant four years ago.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Ohhhh!
0,season7,719rmac,Woman," Im very interested to find out whos been doing her taxes
these last four years."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Thats great!
0,season7,719rmac,Woman," So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You
didnt tell her to come?!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, You were supposed to tell her!
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," No I wasnt! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was
supposed to bring the cake!"
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Fine, Ill go call her."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to
try on."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Wow! This looks great!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is
made of bologna. (Points.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Oh, just until the glue dries."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Thank God!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. "
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Ah.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is
nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, thats really just
for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why dont you go into your room and
try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Ow!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Toothpick?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Yeah.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, What are you trying on now?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, The fruit roll up.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, And?
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Delicious.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, Joey!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, What?! Which one?!
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, The <i>Silly Putty</i>! Its not so silly anymore!
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," (in his head) <i>Shes your cousin. Shes your cousin!</i> <i>If
she knew what was going on in your head shed think you were sick</i>! (She grabs
some popcorn.) <i>Or would she? Lets back up a second. She was the one who
suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She
was the one that wanted to rent </i>Logans Run<i>, the sexiest movie ever. </i>(She
grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) <i>Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I
want it. She wants it. Im going in. </i>"
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
0,season7,719rmac,Ross," (in his head) <i>Say something clever! </i>(Pause.)<i> Okay, doesnt
have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. </i>(Pause)<i> Any words will
do. </i>(Pause) <i>Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! </i>(Pause)<i>
There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! </i>(Pause.) (To
her) I-I, I uh havent had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his
head) <i>Yeah, you really shouldnt have said anything.</i>"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need
me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel
sitting on the couch.) Oh."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, For what?
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
0,season7,719rmac,Monica, You al-you already had it?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people
came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now
you dont have either."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, We ruined everything.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Ugh
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Well no, wait a minute, thats not true! No, what did, that was
really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best."
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel," What do you, what do you mean?"
0,season7,719rmac,Monica," Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I
mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk
to people I dont even like!"
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Surprise
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe, Sur-surprise.
0,season7,719rmac,Rachel, Monica.
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right? "
0,season7,719rmac,The Director, Yeah.
0,season7,719rmac,Joey, My whole familys from Naples!
0,season7,719rmac,The Director," Oh thats great! Okay, well Ive heard everything I need
to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie"
0,season7,719rmac,The Casting Director," Joey, this is the awkward part."
0,season7,719rmac,Joey," Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I
totally understand. You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars
or tattoos. Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands,
back up and looks down.) So there you go, thats me. (We cut to a camera angle
looking at the casting director and movie director through Joeys legs.) One hundred
percent natural! (Suddenly, theres a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is
shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before."
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," Oh! No problem! I (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once
again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping
thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise
Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official
website at www.deniserichards.com.)"
0,season7,719rmac,Cassie, (noticing her) What?
0,season7,719rmac,Phoebe," (in her head) <i>Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! Shes
not your cousin!</i>"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Probably Monica and Chandler.
0,season7,720rbk,Gunther," Oh umm, uh we dont sell cigarettes, but they have them at the
newsstand across the street. (Points.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I dont think I have
the energy for this."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (screaming) Melissa!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,
whats up with you?!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Wh(Turns and looks at the gang whos staring)Why
dont I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachels hand
and notices that she doesnt have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh no-no, no! Its good! Its all good! I-I actually work at <i>Ralph
Lauren</i>!"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, Shut up!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, I will not! Im the divisional head of mens sportswear!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Oh please
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, (excitedly) Are you?!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, No.
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow
night?"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh tomorrow, oh I dont know. Um"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, You do now. Youre having dinner with me.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Shut up.
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," I-Ive got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns
with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so
listen, just call me. Heres my card. (Hands the card over.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh youre in real estate!"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Oh no, thats-thats an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of
that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Wow! What do you do now?
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," (quietly) Im a party planner. Ill see you tomorrow.
(Exits.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Hey guys! Look whos back! Its Ray-ray!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college."
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," She seems really, really fun!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Shes actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Wait a minute, she isnt Shes not the one who you"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (To Monica) Yes.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Wow!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who youwhat?!!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Its not a big deal!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, (To Joey) They were lovers.
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, What?!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, What?!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," No we werent! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a lot of sangria and yknow, ended upkissing for a
bit."
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, So thats two of my wives.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay, so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
peoples names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachels place.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh wow. Why dont we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins arent for playing are they?"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Chandler, relax its not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (entering) Hello!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) 
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Stop picturing it!!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Okay, I think thats it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like theyre having fun dont they?"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Oh! (Gets up) Lets see, wellif this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) youre parents will be at home in Queens."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," What, theyre not invited?! Oh no, thats terrible! Theyre
gonna be crushed!"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Why would they think theyre invited?
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (looking around) You got me. I dont
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Joey!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Well, Im sorry. I thought parents were coming! Yknow? Your
parents are comin! Chandlers parents are comin! Rosss parents are
comin!"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Rosss parents are my parents!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Yknow I think we should invite them.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Oh please, you just want more blue pins."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Well this is just sad!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, That is not a problem.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (leaning down to her) Maybe youll order a little sangria?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin
me!"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," (sees another rack) Well, whats the deal with these? These-these
look nice."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when theyre done with them they just send em back."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, You mean like for award shows?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Some of them.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, ""Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Honey, might I suggest watching a little more <i>ESPN </i>and a little
less <i>E!</i>?"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Umm, well lets see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Not bad.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul ONeil.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Whos that?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, <i>ESPN</i>! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan!"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Pierce Brosnan?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Are you serious?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, 007?! This is James Bonds tux?!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Its a pretty cool tux.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joeys like
in Checkers.) Chess!"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Nice move.
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," No, Im performing the ceremony. Im not wearing a tux."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Well, what are you going to wear?"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Huh. Does Monica know about this?
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, I dont think so.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh, yknow what? I cant. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," (excitedly) Can I come?! I wont even talk! Youll just hear the
noise from my video camera."
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, What is this? Whats going on?
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joeys lewd
version?"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Joeys!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Okay
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one timeshe and I yknowkissed a little bit."
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," (laughs) Yeah, Im sure that happened."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, It-it did!
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Sure!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! "
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Why are you taking this away from me?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Okay! I justI didnt know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Im not saying that Im a lesbian! Im just saying that
this happened!"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Okay, it just seems pretty wild and youre soyknow
sovanilla."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (shocked) Vanilla?!
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Yeah.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Im not vanilla! Ive done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, To Ross.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," All right, yknow what? If you dont want to believe me about
this, why dont you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you."
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Okay! All right! Yeah! Cause I just cant picture it.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans
tux!"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, What?
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit filmthat Batman film he was in."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James
Bonds tux!"
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, So?
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!"
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Pretty please? Not very uh, 007."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you."
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, When I got married you slept with my sister.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, That was pretty 007.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Hey. Oh good-good youre here! All right, I figured it out.
Im gonna take two tables of eight, Im gonna add your parents, and Im
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go!"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Yeah, theyre not coming."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, (looking at him) What?!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
Theyfeel a little unwanted."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Oh thats too bad. Its true, but too bad."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Look Mon, if you could just call my mom"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Oh Joey!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Come on! Look just-just telllet her know that you really want them
to be there. Lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, No she hasnt.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, Is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you?
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Well, what am I going to say?"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," I dont know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, orNo-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post
office. And the Irish! But I dont think you can blame it on them, so (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah Im just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent werent delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What, are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three
years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for
his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta
Beta Pi at Syracuse."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Oh. Oh, thats great!"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, What one?
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Yeah! Yknow, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Oh, isnt a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, (shocked) What?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Remember?! Wecome on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, Yeah?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," we went back to the house and we got really silly and wewe made
out."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what youre talking about."
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Really?!
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Ross is Batman!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond!"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Batman has a utility belt!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, 007 has a fancy car!
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Batman has the Batmobile!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, 007 gets all the ladies.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get <i>ESPN</i> right?
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice
martini."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Actually, I dont like martinis."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, How about a <i>Youhoo</i> with a funny straw?
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey, (entering) Hey.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Hey.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Listen, I know the invitation says 6"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, The show?!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, its gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is its the same day as my
nieces christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
Cause my parts just in the beginning Im not even in the rest of the
showWedding!"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, The wedding starts at six.
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
til they get there?"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Youll vamp?!
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Yeah! Yeah yknow, like warm up the crowd. Ask em where
theyre from. Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an
entertainer. Im a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no-one better! There is no-one
greater!"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, How can you not remember us kissing?!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," I dont know. I dont remember a lot of things that never
happened."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Wh Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldnt stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin together?"
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Oh, somewhere Joeys head is exploding."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Yeahbut come onListen, Im sorry I dont want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesnt believe
me."
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Im sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, No!!
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe," Rachel, its okay. You dont have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Thank you Phoebe.
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, She didnt.
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, I know.
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, You just carry that around?
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, Between you and
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why dont we put them on? Yknow
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Well, does that mean that youre not going to be wearing yours?"
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," What, are you kidding? Its Batmans tux!!"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, (standing up) Let me try it on!
0,season7,720rbk,Ross," Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin in
there."
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) Whats this?"
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, What?
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," An invitation for the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy!"
0,season7,720rbk,Ross, Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?"
0,season7,720rbk,Monica," All right thats it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the
altar and
scream racial slurs? I dont care!"
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. Theyre so happy they get to be a part of your special day."
0,season7,720rbk,Monica, (defeated) Oh.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad
theyre coming."
0,season7,720rbk,Joey," Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, It happened! I am telling you it happened!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I
dont think Ill be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, yknow
youve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys."
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and Im not
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you dont remember that, maybe
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, My God! You love me!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (shocked) What?
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can
still hear the coconuts knockin together I (Phoebe is shocked.) I just
didnt want to tell you cause I didnt think that youd return my
love, and now that you have (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," Aww, look whos being suddenly shy. You cant tell me you
dont feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, (moves away again) I-I-I-Im justIm just a good kisser!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa, (suddenly frightened) Shut up!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Im sorry!
0,season7,720rbk,Melissa," (laughs) Oh you dont have to be (Laughs again) sorry.
ImIm obviously kidding. Im not in love with you. (To Phoebe)
Im not in love with her. I dont hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I
dontpicture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.
Ehkiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and
drives off.)"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, What the hell was that?!
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, And?
0,season7,720rbk,Phoebe, Ive had better.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel," Well yknow what they say, the 23<sup>rd</sup> times the
charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!"
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Whose is it?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler, Whose is it?
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, I dont want to say.
0,season7,720rbk,Chandler," Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?"
0,season7,720rbk,Rachel, Diane Keaton.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married?
Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Do you realize you get louder each week?
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow.
(Laughs)"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
0,season7,721vows,Monica," (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now.
Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sits
down, and starts feverishly writing.)"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (watching in her) (in his head) <i>Look at her go! She must love me
more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door</i>."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) There
are no words! This should not be this hard!"
0,season7,721vows,Joey," All right, uh (To Ross) Oh hey, youve done this before Ross,
well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I
die. She made no such promise."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You
shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Monica what? 
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, What?!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, What is the emergency?!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," You have to help me! Im supposed to be writing my vows and all I
have is this! (Shows them what shes been working on.)"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Thank you.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm,
Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Yeah, Im not sure I can do that."
0,season7,721vows,Ross," ...everyone, this is Chandler!"
0,season7,721vows,Fat Monica," Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, (seeing her) Okay.
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even
though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."""
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Ennnh.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you
just say something about, yknow, all the things that hes taught you. Like
(They all try to think about one example and dont succeed.) Or all the things you
taught him."
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than
three), five, six, and seven!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) Thats one?
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Its kind of an important one!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
couldve meant.)"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean back
on the couch satisfied.)"
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, (writing) Monica
0,season7,721vows,Joey," ""when I look back over our time together"""
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Well, I cant do everything! Look back over your time together."
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, You'll get one.
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Oh yeah? When?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," No, no, no."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (trapped) Uh, uh."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Well?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Nice try.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Look, Monica"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, This is not going to work.
0,season7,721vows,Monica, I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, You are so great! I love you!
0,season7,721vows,Monica, What?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, No I didn't!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Yes, you did!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, No I didn't!
0,season7,721vows,Monica, You love me!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler,"  Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Then all your stuff would be here.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesnt make any sense."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im
saying?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, You wanted it to be a surprise.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Oh my God.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a
reason why girls dont do this!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,
I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I
thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
(Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you
marry me?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Yes.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
Were engaged!!!"
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Hey!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because
Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
0,season7,721vows,Joey," How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Hows Monica coming along with her vows?
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Well lets just say its.. shes lucky she has a sweet ass,
cause shes not so good at the writing."
0,season7,721vows,Ross, I cant believe that in four weeks theyre gonnta be married!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Well lets just hope it works. Yknow, nine out of ten
marriages end in divorce?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Phoebe thats not true.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Yeah, youre right. Hows the Mrs.?"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, I cant believe theyve been together for three years.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (shocked) Has it been that long?!
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," I've had a very long, hard day."
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Okay.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Hey Joe!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a <em>Coke</em>(Yelps
in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)<em>Diet Coke</em>."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, I dont know why they didnt just tell us.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, I know! I mean its not like we werent cool about it.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
0,season7,721vows,Joey, How?! When?!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, It happened in London.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, IN LONDON!!!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell."
0,season7,721vows,Joey," All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm
gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Oh my God!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, YOU KNOW?!!!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop
screaming!!"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, (entering) What's going on?
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! "
0,season7,721vows,Ross, What?! What?!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!"
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel
knows?"
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Bye!
0,season7,721vows,All, Bye!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Actually, I did!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Phoebe knows about us!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Well I didn't tell them!
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Them?! Who's them?
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Joey!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see,
they don't know that we know that they know! So"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Are you kidding?!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, No!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?"
0,season7,721vows,Joey, No.
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Joey!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, They know you know.
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!"
0,season7,721vows,Joey, I couldn't even if I wanted to.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! "
0,season7,721vows,Monica, She's bluffing!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Ooh!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Okay!
0,season7,721vows,Joey," I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, It's not my first time.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Of course.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Oh, you're-you're going?"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very
happy we're gonna have all the sex."
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Not if I kiss you first.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Ooh.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Here it comes. Our first kiss.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, And why not?!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Because I'm in love with Monica!!
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, You're-you're what?!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica."
0,season7,721vows,Monica," I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!"
0,season7,721vows,Joey,  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Well actually, Ross doesn't."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
0,season7,721vows,Ross," (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta
change things."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, You really think it would be that different?
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," How could it not be? I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having
kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a <i>Volvo</i>
dealership."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Well, things change."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, I dont want them to move to a <i>Volvo</i> dealership!
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Itll be okay Joe.
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Im sorry, I justI like things the way they are."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Aww, look at the little thing."
0,season7,721vows,Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Who are those people?
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Got me.
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. "
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
0,season7,721vows,Ross," (looking) No-no, that would be me again."
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Hey, you guys!"
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Hey.
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Hey.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, Whats going on?
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Well, we were just talkin about you guys gettin married and
how great it is."
0,season7,721vows,Joey," Yeah, you can get a <i>Volvo</i>. If thats what you really want."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Oh thats so sweet.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, So we both finished our vows.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Oh!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," Oh, can we read them?"
0,season7,721vows,Monica," Yeah, I dont hear Chandlers and he doesnt hear mine."
0,season7,721vows,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season7,721vows,Phoebe," (To Monica) Oh, thats beautiful."
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! Thats good!
0,season7,721vows,Rachel," (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?"
0,season7,721vows,Joey, What? I dont get it.
0,season7,721vows,Ross," (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious."
0,season7,721vows,Monica, Chandler!!
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Dont worry honey, well make yours funnier."
0,season7,721vows,Chandler," Okay, what do you guys think?"
0,season7,721vows,Ross, (quietly) Dude!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, You really like it?
0,season7,721vows,Ross, Dude! How-how did you write this?
0,season7,721vows,Chandler, I stole Monicas and changed the name.
0,season7,721vows,Ross, You cant do that!
0,season7,721vows,Joey, If he goes first he can!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?
Thought Id take that bad boy out for a little spin."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and
when I ask you, you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Yeah, well hes my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could
never hurt it."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Its a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after
youre done."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, (entering) Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin good. When do I get to take
that baby out again?"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Ive never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it
all the time."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Nice work everybody! So much for the yknow, ""You can drive
it, but dont tell Rachel"" plan!"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Wow! I cant believe you lied to me.
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about
is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I wont let you drive the
Porsche is because youre a terrible driver. There! That wasnt about the
wedding."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche Ill be glad
to take you for a quick spin around the block."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Whew! That was a brisk ride!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Take the top down did ya?
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Only way to fly.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what
shes talking about! I am an excellent driver!"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Youre fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She mustve seen me
cruising in the bad boy."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, I think shes checking out your beehive Ross.
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Gimme the keys!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, No way!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Well no brush!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Fine! Yknow what? It doesnt matter, because, if I remember
correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. "
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an
invitation."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I
havent seen him in years."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the
same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna
be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I
dont care."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, My God!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, What do you think youre doing?!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off
of the hood.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why dont
you just hand over the keys?"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Oh.
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay!
Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the
twenty Rachel stole and doesnt find it.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Look Ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, With you?! Yeah right!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, All right. (She starts off.)
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, What are you doing?! Get in the front!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, In the death seat?!!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Oh my
0,season7,722towcd,Man, Hey guys!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Hey sweetie!
0,season7,722towcd,Man, Ready to go?
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monicas. Ill be right
back. (She goes to get it.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Man, (stopping her) Wait a minute!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.
(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
0,season7,722towcd,Man, Over a month.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little
better."
0,season7,722towcd,Man," Sure, Id like that."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," So uh, whats your name?"
0,season7,722towcd,Man, (laughs) It's Jake.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
0,season7,722towcd,Jake," Yeah, big fan."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?"
0,season7,722towcd,Jake," Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything
Tuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt
revealing a pink lace secret.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Whats this?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!
No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well
save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our
wedding be bigger please?"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two
talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Yknow we already went over this and I won!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," No you didnt. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that youre
marrying me, you dont get to win anymore."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see
him. I dont wanna."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know"
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd
have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,
he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing
speedosThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the
stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing
a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a
healthy snack!"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was
there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Whos Mr. Garibaldi?
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Does it matter?!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time
that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your weddingyoure
gonna regret it for the rest of your life."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Yes!
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, So I really never get to win anymore?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, How much did ever really win before?
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Pheebs!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean
forward I check out your underwear?"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens
underwear!"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, I know. They were mine.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, thats weird!"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try
them on."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Thats weird!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Im wearing his briefs right now.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Thatskinda hot.
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah, I wouldnt know about that."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually
more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high
heels are good for his posture!"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking
even more than you."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his
masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! I dont think you could ever
do that."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Okay, whatever."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Youve seen my huge stack of porn, right? (Phoebe nods.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my
license renewed."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," (shocked) You dont have a valid drivers
licenseOkay that is it! Pull over right now!"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Oh Ross youre so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to
relax all right? Just need to relax (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are youOkay
thats not funny! Just stop horsing around!"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that
much trouble."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Really? You think so?
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, I was talking to myself! Youre going down!
0,season7,722towcd,A Waiter in Drag, (to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)
Im-Im sorry Im new. I dont"
0,season7,722towcd,Waiter in Drag, (To Chandler) Hm-mmm?
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Waiter in Drag, Youre straight. I get it. (Walks away.)
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better
seats."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," No! No! I dont want him to know were here yet! Im not
sure Im ready for that. And besides, hes not gonna be too happy to see me
either."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Why not?!
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," I dont know if Ive told you this, but hes kinda
tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, What?!
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New
York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very <i>Cats
in the Cradle</i>I dont want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go."
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, Hello darlings.
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, And theres daddy!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! Ill
go under, you go over!"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Yeah, Ill get right on that."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under
his leg.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, Im sure we wont get arrested
for this."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?"
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Oh my God.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Can I see your license please?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Oh yes, absolutely! Yknow, its weird uh, but I had a dream
last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uhwell I probably
shouldnt tell you the rest."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Your license?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Thats Hanson.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Oops sorry, my mistake."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Dear Lord!!
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Wow!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Here it comes.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, This is a great picture.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Really?! You think so? Yknow, I had just rolled out of bed."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Yknow youre-youre probably wondering about the old
date on there."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Yes I am.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Yeah.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman," Youre an Aquarius, huh?"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, I bet youre a Gemini. 
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Nope.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Taurus?
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Nope.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Virgo?
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Nope.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Sagittarius?
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Yep.
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," I knew it! I knew it, ahh."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Well I tell you what
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Yeah?
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Youre not gonna speed anymore right?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, I wont speed.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, And you promise youll get this taken care of right away?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, I promise.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Yeah!
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Can he handle the stick?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Oh well
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, I can handle the stick!!
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," <i>I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and</i>(She
holds the mike out to the audience.)"
0,season7,722towcd,All, Gay!
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, That cant be your father.
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, What?
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Thats Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," (singing) <i>For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy</i>!
(Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience.
And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the
audience."
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Relax! Youll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table
light.) Oh much better. Youre invisible now."
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," (standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there) Where are you
from?"
0,season7,722towcd,Guy, Bakersfield.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, Im sorry? (Holds out the mike.)
0,season7,722towcd,Guy, Bakersfield!
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, No-no I heard! Im just sorry.
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at the
hotel."
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," (to Chandlers back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early
in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around.
Helena recognizes him.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica," Can we have our drinks please?! WaiterUh, tress!"
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Hey!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe
that hes got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yknow, Im beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, The silk? Feels really good!
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Huh.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah! And-and things arent assmashed down as I thought they
were gonna be."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Thats great Joe!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with
mens underwear!"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! Youve got cotton,
silk, lace! And yknow what Ive always wondered about?"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Hmm?
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Pantyhose! Yknow? The way they start at your toe and go all the way
up to here (He mimed that and stops when he realizes he went too far.) I should go
take these off shouldnt I?"
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, I think its important that you do.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, So whats your name?
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," Chandler? What an unusual name! You mustve had terribly fascinating
parents."
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," Oh, theyre a hoot."
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, (To Monica) And who is your friend?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, Im-Im Monica.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, Monica! Where are you from?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, New York.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing
Monicas ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who
woos.) Honey! Huh?"
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Actually Monica and I are engaged.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, Really?! Congratulations. Whens the big day?
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, (looks at Chandler) Inin two weeks.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," (disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of
happiness. (To a bald guy.) So youre bald?"
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," I know it would make me happy, maam."
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," Well I wouldnt miss it for the world. Oh! Im getting all
misty here! Youd think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on
stage.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Monica, (To Chandler) You okay?
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler, Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
0,season7,722towcd,Helena," Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom
how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall.
Fortunately, in my life (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing
else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) <i>Its raining men! </i>"
0,season7,722towcd,Helena, <i>Its raining men!</i>
0,season7,722towcd,Chandler," (To Monica) When I was growing up Iplayed the one on the far
left."
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Remind me to introduce you to someone!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Who?
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Fourth gear!!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, What?! What does he want?! I wasnt doing anything!
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel," Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two
oclock position."
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Maybe its uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
(They pull over.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Its a different guy!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Good evening officer.
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," Ah no. I dont, but it could not have been more than sixty."
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Youre right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," I mean youre not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are
ya?"
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Thats right.
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, Yknow of-officer I uhI had the weirdest dream last night
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, Oh my God!
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman, Your license please.
0,season7,722towcd,Ross," (laughs) You dont-you dont want to hear about my dream
OfficerPretty?"
0,season7,722towcd,Policeman," Its Petty. (He grabs Rosss license.) Ill be right
back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)"
0,season7,722towcd,Rachel, (pause) You have a son!
0,season7,722towcd,Ross, I know. I know.
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe, Feel better?
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my
manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right
now."
0,season7,722towcd,Phoebe," Yeah, I understand."
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and
goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!"
0,season7,722towcd,Woman, Hi!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
0,season7,722towcd,Woman, I dont think so.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on <i>Days
of Our Lives</i>."
0,season7,722towcd,Woman, Wow!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Yeah.
0,season7,722towcd,Woman, Really?!
0,season7,722towcd,Joey, Hm-mmm.
0,season7,722towcd,Waitress, (to the woman) $4.50 please.
0,season7,722towcd,Joey," Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with
it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Do you realize this is probably the last time well all be here in
the coffee house as six single people?"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.)
Oh! (Realizes.)"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the
mrs. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain."
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Old?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, The young hot ball and chain.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Thats much better.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Oh, where are you guys going?"
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Were gonna pick up the wedding dress, then were gonna have
lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Ah. Joey, youre-youre having lunch with my mom?"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (To Chandler) Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre
leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Whats up?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Well this uh, this may be a little awkward."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im
buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
0,season7,723camw,Ross," No, itsIts not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you,
Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as
Monicas older brother."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, But youre still my friend?
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Not for the next few minutes.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," During this timeare you, are you still my best man?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Nope.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Do I still call you Ross?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be
more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother I-I have to tell you
this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any
kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What?
Im-Im-Im serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) ComeHey! Dude! Stop
it! Okay? Im-Im not kidding here!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the
warning."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, No problem.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, So are wefriends again?
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Yeah.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Okay. (Pause) You wont believe what Monicas older
brother just said to me!"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Whatcha doing Mon?
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Im making a list of all the things that are most likely to go
wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, What are they?
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Well, so far I have uh, my bridesmaids' dresses wont get
picked up, my veil gets lost, or I dont have my something blue."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Hey! Those are all the things Im responsible for!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, I had to go with the odds Rach.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," (entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and
didnt get the part?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, The commercial?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, No!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, That play?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, No!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, That other play?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Nooo!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, The movie?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yes!!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Ohh!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Yes, thats the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! Back then yknow, we called it the Great War. It really was!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start
shooting today!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Congratulations!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh thats great!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Wait! Wait! Wait! You cant start today! Todays the rehearsal
dinner!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Oh no, Ill be done by then."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Oh. Well then way to go, you big movie star!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," I know! All right, Ill see you guys over there! Im off to
fight the Nazis."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I."
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she
thinks.)"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Go ahead.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Youre gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Who did we fight in World War I?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Mexico?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Yes! Very good.
0,season7,723camw,The Assistant Director, (approaching) Hey Joey! Were ready.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)
0,season7,723camw,The Assistant Director," (to another actor) Richard? Were ready for you.
(Richard approaches.) Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby, hes playing Vincent."
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Im doing my scenes with you?
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Nice to meet you Joey.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Wow! I cant believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an
Oscar!"
0,season7,723camw,Richard, No I didnt.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, I think you did.
0,season7,723camw,Richard, I think I lost. Three times.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, UhCookie?
0,season7,723camw,The Director," (approaching) Okay! Were about an hour away from getting the
scene lit. So uh, if you guys dont mind, can we run it a couple of times?"
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Yeah, sure."
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Okay, all right. Lets do it. (He walks off.)
AndAction!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, We have to find the rest of the platoon!
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! (He is spitting on the hard Ps
and Ts.)"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, (wiping his face) What?!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, (still spitting) The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," (wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no
food!"
0,season7,723camw,Richard," No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry
pasta!"
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something
wrong?"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," (glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uhI thI thought it might be
kind of a cool character thing. Yknow? Hes uh, hes a face toucher.
(Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)"
0,season7,723camw,The Director," I dont think so. Lets take it back to Richards
last line. (Walks off.) Action!"
0,season7,723camw,Richard," We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I
saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna! (Joey backs away and wipes his
face again.)"
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Honey, we gotta go!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Heres a question you never
have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl
necklaces."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (laughs) I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if
Rachel does."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Yes, include more people in this."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting
married?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," I just, I cant believe that we made it!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Well you dont have to sound so surprised.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Im sorry butnothing.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, What?
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Wellhonestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for
something to.. to flip you out."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Honestly? Me too.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Really?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come
up and Ill go allChandler. But nothing has."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Ohh, Im so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during
this. I mean its really, its made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.)
I coulda been worse!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Okay. Ill be right there.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (voice on answering machine) Hi! If youre calling before Saturday,
youve reached Monica and Chandler. But if youre calling after Saturday,
youve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!"
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin
Maureen."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Were the Bings.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother
chat with Chandler."
0,season7,723camw,Monica, What is that?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Well II told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and
kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I
am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Hi.
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing, Chandler!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (Shes wearing a
tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)"
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing," Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad
this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon therell be lots of little Bings.
(He freaks out and loosens the tie again.) "
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, (shaking her hand) Its lovely to meet you.
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, (shaking her hand) So are you his mother or his father?
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, Jack!
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, What?! Ive never seen one before!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Dad! Theres Ross (points), why dont you go talk to him?"
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller," I didnt even have a chance to act as though Im okay with
it!"
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Bing, (entering) Hello all!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Hidad.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Hi Mr.Bing.

0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing, Charles.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, It-its so great to see you both here.
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Bing," Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some
people. Arent you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?"
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing," Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress
like that?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, of course you can kick his ass son.
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, You could kick anyones ass you want to.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would you
talk to
Chandlers dad and try to keep him away from Chandlers mom?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Yeah! But I dont know what he looks like!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, He is the man in the black dress.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Man in the black dress (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around
to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! Im Rachel! Im a friend of
Monica and Chandlers!"
0,season7,723camw,Woman, Im Amanda.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh I get it! Amanduh!
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyones attention please?
Im uh; Im Ross Geller."
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, Doctor Ross Geller.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Daddad, please! As I was saying umm, Im Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh,
and Im the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not
only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, shes
the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if youd all please join me in raising a
glass to the, the couple were here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings."
0,season7,723camw,All, To the Bings!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," All right, Im gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the
responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Ill do it.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Who wants it? Anybody?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, I said Ill do it!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Monica! Im not gonna screw it up!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Yknow what? Youre right, Im sorry. Actually you were a
big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure
she got to the hotel safely."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Well of course that is what Im here for!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Hey! Where have you been?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel."
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Oh.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, What? Are you going back to work?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yeah.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Nice shades.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I wont
get spit in the eyes, yknow?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," And if I remember correctly, <i>Ray Ban</i> was the official sponsor of
World War I!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Great! All right. Ill see you later. (He starts to leave.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Hey, wheres Chandler?"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Uh, I think hes in Rachels room. See ya. (Exits.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (going up to Rachels closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and
looks inside and doesnt see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still
doesnt find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Hey! 
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Hi!
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Is uh, is Monica here?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Shes steaming her dress, why? Whats up?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, I think Chandlers gone. (He hands her the note.)
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, What?!
0,season7,723camw,Ross, He left that.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, (reading the note) Tell Monica Im sorry.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," (walking up) Whats up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads
it.) Tell Monica Im sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica
Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his
name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, I think it means he freaked out and left!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry
is sitting in there (Joey and Rachels apartment) right now?!"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find
him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," (pointing at Ross) Okay but if you dont find him and bring
him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (scared) I will, I will find him."
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me? (Hes
holding a script.)"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Just the last two pages.
0,season7,723camw,Joey,  Alright.
0,season7,723camw,Richard, I found the picture! 
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Picture? What picture?
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I
can uh, play off your reaction."
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Okay uh, look I know youre a great actor, okay? And you play all
those Shakespeare guys and stuff"
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Oh, thanks."
0,season7,723camw,Joey, But youre spittin all over me man!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Well of course I am!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, You know youve been spitting on me?!
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Thats what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good
actor! And when you enunciate, you spit! (Spits on the t) "
0,season7,723camw,Joey, (wiping face) Wow! Didnt know that.
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Great!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What
picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
0,season7,723camw,Gunther," No. No, I havent seen him."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Oh damn!
0,season7,723camw,Gunther," Hes getting married tomorrow, right?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Yes. Yes. Dont worry. Everythings fine. Well uh,
well see you tomorrow at the wedding."
0,season7,723camw,Gunther, I wasnt invited.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Well then, well-well see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks
away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (Theyre sitting by the window.)
What-whatwhat you guys doing here?!"
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller," Well, you kids talk about this place so much, we thought wed
see what all the fuss is about."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, I certainly see why the girls like coming here.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Why?!
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller," The sexy blonde behind the counter. (She waves at Gunther who waves
back.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, (shocked) Gunther?!
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, Your mother just added him to her list.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, What? Your-your list?
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller," Yeah, the list thatof people were allowed to
sleep"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see
Chandler, could you just let him know Im looking for him?"
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller," And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know Im looking for her."
0,season7,723camw,The Director, Action!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, I found the picture!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, What picture?!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, The picture of my wife! In your pack!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, You went through my personal property?
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," (pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!"
0,season7,723camw,The Director, Cut! Wonderful!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Great scene yeah?
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me."
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Thanks a lot.
0,season7,723camw,The Assistant Director, (To Joey) Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Oh, Im-Im not working tomorrow."
0,season7,723camw,The Assistant Director, You are now.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," No! No! I cant! You gotta get me out of it! Ive got plans!
(Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, (closing the door) Ross said theres still no word from Chandler.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh man.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth
avenue."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Okay. Well theres one down.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (entering from her room, excitedly) Im getting married today!!!
(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I dont care
because todays my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Yknow she might not even notice hes gone.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (re-entering) Im gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her
room.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," God! DontWe cant let her start getting ready! This is
too awful! Oh God, but wait shell be in the gown and then he wont show up and
then shes gonna have to take off the gown"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You cant do this here! (She drags
her into the bathroom.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Im sorry. Im sorry. Its justIts just so
sad!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cant
see you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong!"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) Theres no tissue! Can you
grab me some toilet paper?"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas
bathroom right?!"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, No-no! I-II found one.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have
another one?"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you
need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler
doesnt show up!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh heres a whole bunch.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people
will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Yknow? Then shell have to
come back here and live all alone."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, What?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive.
Monicas pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she wont be totally
alone."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh my God!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her
something new?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh my God!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash
last night."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is
pregnant. The groom is missing. And Im still holding this. (She throws the test back
into the trash.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Right.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Okay?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was
using?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, No. Why?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Anything?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I
talked to Chandlers parents again!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, You told them he was missing?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both
think Im interested in them."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," All right, weve got to tell her hes gone. (Starts to leave.)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, No! Hey! Hey! We cant!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Ross, shes gonna start getting ready soon!"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Well, cant you at least stall her a little? Ill-Ill go
back to some of the places I went last night."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," All right, well how much time do you need?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, One hour.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Give me two.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Then why do you ask?!
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Okay, wish me luck."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Okay. Im going with you.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Why?!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly
you suck at this."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," All right, Ill see you guys later."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Okay. Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Ill figure something out.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, All right. Good luck.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Thanks.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Hey! Okay, so I thought wed start with my make up and then do my
hair."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me."
0,season7,723camw,Monica, About what?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Umm Im never gonna getting married!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we
done with that?"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," No Monica! Im serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something."
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little
problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasnt supposed to work today, and I have
this wedding that I really have to be at. Its my best friends, and Im
officiating so I really cant work past four."
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We cant stop filming
just for you. Its not like its your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Im having surgery!
0,season7,723camw,The Director, What?!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnt
want you to worry about me. But, Im having surgery today."
0,season7,723camw,The Director, What kind of surgery?!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Transplant.
0,season7,723camw,The Director, But youre supposed to work on Monday.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Hair transplant.
0,season7,723camw,The Director, But youre not bald.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Its not on my head.
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Look Joey, theres nothing I can do. Besides, youre
probably gonna be out by four anyway. Weve just got one short scene. Its just
you and Richard, and God knows hes a pro. Youll be fine. (Walks away and sees
Richard entering.) Morning Richard."
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Hey! Youre here! Great! Great! Great! Lets get going buddy,
weve got a scene to shoot!"
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Im wearing two belts.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Are you drunk?
0,season7,723camw,Richard, No!
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yes you are!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, All right.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, We are never gonna find him! Hes one guy in a huge city!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross," That is an old, Chinese woman!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," He could be in disguise, yknow."
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Aw, yknowYknow, maybe were-were just
approaching this all wrong. If youre Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the
last place on Earth people would think youd go?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, So this is your office?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, What the hell are you doing?!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im
related to Monica. How is she?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Shes fine. She doesnt know youre gone. And she
doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, No! No! No! I cant do that!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Why not?!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant
be the Bings!"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Whats wrong with being the Bings?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use
the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to
your hotel room?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, No.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Then you are neither of your parents!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at
everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And
Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn!
None of my proceeds go to charity."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I
do. But I totally believe you can do this."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too
huge."
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we
take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just
forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Well yeah, but then"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (interrupting him) YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go
home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Depends on what you mean by we.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!
And thats every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again"
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,
Rachel Im sorry! I have to start getting ready! Im getting married today!"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, I know. At dusk. Thats such a hard time for me.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," (getting up) Im gonna go put my make-up on, we have to be at the
hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Okay. But wait!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, What?!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Lets go to lunch.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, I cant go to lunch!!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Right.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh good God! Ive fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
0,season7,723camw,Monica, (entering) Whats going on?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Okay. Alright. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what Im
about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love
you."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Okay, youre-youre really freaking me out."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," We cant find Chandler(Phoebe sticks her head and motions
that they found Chandler)s vest. We cant find Chandlers vest."
0,season7,723camw,Monica," How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," (entering) Found the vest! I mean were gonna have to keep an eye
on it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again"
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Oh wow! Okay. Dont scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute
there I was like, ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!"" "
0,season7,723camw,Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
0,season7,723camw,Richard, That can be arranged.
0,season7,723camw,The Director, Lets reset.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
0,season7,723camw,The Director, Lets take it from there.
0,season7,723camw,Richard, (To Joey) Are you a little off today? Its going terribly slowly.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And
Im the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Of course! Im-Im sorry. I-Id hate you to miss
anything like that on account of me. I can do this!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Thank you. Thank you.
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Still rolling, annnnd action!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,
causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, Here comes the bride.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh my God Monica!
0,season7,723camw,Monica, I wanna wear this everyday.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, You look so beautiful.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, (starting to cry) Im so happy for me.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Hello?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, (on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine."
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Damnit!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, What? Why? Where are you?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Im still on the set!
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
0,season7,723camw,Joey," I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go
until we get this."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on
the phone, Ill marry them right now."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
0,season7,723camw,Joey," Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I
have the power!"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnt so scary, was it?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, No.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Im telling you, just a little bit at a time."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Yeah okay. Well, whats the next little bit?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that
too! Just like youve done everything else!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Yeah. Youre right. Hey I-I can do that.
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Yeah.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)"
0,season7,723camw,Ross," WhHeyWhoa-whoa, where, where you going?!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh
air."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Oh fresh air!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do that
yknow."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well,
yknow. I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. So Im
gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant
because they
frown on that."
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {Its a good thing
Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they
were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and
maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (Hes wearing an
interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another
wedding. Can you do that?"
0,season7,723camw,The Rabbi, I dont know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel," Yeah! Yeah. Theyretheyre-theyre my friends, uh,
Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus."
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm,
anyone seen Chandler?"
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, I thought he was with you.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide
and seek."
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller," You cant ask us son, thats cheating."
0,season7,723camw,Ross," (pause) Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller," Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in
the wedding dress."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing," As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding
dress."
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Bing," But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing," Honey, it isnt good luck."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Oh my God! Monica!
0,season7,723camw,Monica," I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?"
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Are you okay?
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Uh-huh.
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Well, youre-youre sweating."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, These-these are beads of joy.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Yeah!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Whats going on?
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Chandlers gone again!
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe," Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a
flight risk?!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
0,season7,723camw,The Director," Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes
conscious were still shooting."
0,season7,723camw,Richard, You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
0,season7,723camw,Joey," So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done
for the day."
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Well have we finished the scene?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
0,season7,723camw,Richard, As were you.
0,season7,723camw,Joey," So I got your car, its right outside."
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Why? Are we done for the day?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Thats what you told me.
0,season7,723camw,Richard," Oh, thank you. Youre welcome. (He stands up, staggers to the
couch, and starts to lie down.)"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a firemans
carry and carries him out.) Here we go."
0,season7,723camw,Richard, Is that my ass? (Hes looking at Joeys.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross, (turning a corner) There he is!!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, What?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Hey! Oh!
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Youre not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass
kicking we talked about!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Ross! (He starts to get up.)
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) Im serious! Youre not
walking out on my sister!"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, (standing up) Thats right! Im not!
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Then where the hell have you been?!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, I know about Monica.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, You know?!
0,season7,723camw,Ross, What?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, What?! What?! Talking about what?!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, You dont know?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Know whatIf somebody doesnt tell me whats going on right
now"
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, What? Youll hi-ya?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Monicas pregnant.
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Oh my God. Oh my God! And youre-youreyoure not
freaking out?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of
cigarettes"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thats when I
uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)
Yeah, yknow what? I thought anything that can fit into this, cant be scary."
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give
Monica so shed know I was okay."
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Dude. (Hugs him.)
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, Way to go son! I knew youd find him!
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Bing, Our little boy is getting married.
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Bing, Oh look at you! So handsome!
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look
beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad you're
here. (He kisses his mom.)"
0,season7,723camw,The Rabbi, Are you Chandler?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Are you Joey?
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Huh. This is nice.
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, What?
0,season7,723camw,Ross," Ive never walked down the aisle knowing it cant end in
divorce."
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller, Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Shes right there.
0,season7,723camw,Mrs. Geller," Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on
the cheek.) Congratulations darling."
0,season7,723camw,Mr. Geller, I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
0,season7,723camw,Monica, Not now.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Okay.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, (To Chandler) Who is this?
0,season7,723camw,The Rabbi, I am Father Kalebasous.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, (in Monicas ear) Hes Greek Orthodox.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, (leaning in) As are you
0,season7,723camw,The Rabbi, Let us begin. Dearly beloved
0,season7,723camw,Joey," (entering) Thats my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I
can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little
late. You may be confused by this now, (Hes still in costume) but you wont be
Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again.
Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man
and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a
long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,
as Ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?"
0,season7,723camw,Monica, (To Rachel) He took off?
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
0,season7,723camw,Monica," Chandler, for so long II wondered if I would ever find my prince,
my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.
And instead, I found everything that Id ever been looking for my whole life. And
nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with
you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you dont want to. You go!"
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Chandler?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler," (To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I
thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I
saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises
that come our way, its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was
meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in and
kisses her.)"
0,season7,723camw,Joey," You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in
me by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?"
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, I do.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, I do.
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Yeah you do!
0,season7,723camw,Ross, Rings?
0,season7,723camw,Joey, Aw crap! Okayuhuh lets-lets do the rings. 
0,season7,723camw,Joey," We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again."
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, What baby?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Our baby.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, We have a baby?
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
0,season7,723camw,Monica, I didnt take a pregnancy test.
0,season7,723camw,Chandler, Thenwho did?
0,season7,723camw,Phoebe, Oh and theyre gonna have a baby.
0,season7,723camw,Rachel, Uh-huh.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Its a tradition here on <i>Friends</i> after every taping for me to
hang out with you guys, (They all laugh) talk down the episode umm The point of this
whole thing is what people see in America is"
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Once and a while.
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, From time to time.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," For example, I dont have to memorize lines. You guys actually have
to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?"
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew," Our energy just comes way up when theres an audience here, and
when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it
just doesnt, it just doesnt work."
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. I did."
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler," Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone
else to laugh.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe," So, we realize thatOh no (She resets herself) Im
telling it! Im telling it (She loses it.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Ha-ha. LookCome on, I dont know what to door say. (He
laughs.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Ha-ha, very funny. I dont know what to do! Yknow? Holy crud!"
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I dont know what to do! (Long pause, as
everyone cracks up.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, It is one of those days!
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe," Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay[Beep]uck it!"
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan, You still get nervous everybody just before a show?
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, Absolutely.
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, Everybody.
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney," Its amazing, like all week long weve-weve been saying
the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up
once
then youll get nervous because youllyou know youll probably mess
up again."
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Action!
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," (holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you slept
through-through the Grand Canyon."
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Watch again that hand.
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, Thisll be five/ten takes.
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Okay.
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, Okay. You know its gonna happen.
0,season7,outtakes,The Director," Once again, and action!"
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," (the hands still there) When-when you were little you slept
through the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney," Oh! Okay! Im gonna try it without the coffee cup cause I
think its the left hand thats messing me up."
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," When you were little you slept through the Grand(Pointing
again)Oh fffff."
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," Sorry, lets go back! Cause youve got more to say."
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa," Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, thats your fault. Isay."
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, I love you.
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, I love you! (They hug.)
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," But there must be, there mustare a lot of moments over the years
where youre just trying to do your job, something goes wrong."
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Hey and, this is a little extra something for yknow, always being
there for me."
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
0,season7,outtakes,Matt, What?!
0,season7,outtakes,David, Ahh! Sh(Beep)it that hurt!
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Are you okay?
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler, Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monicas.)
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Oh yeah? Then how come I keep(He notices that the marker board they
use has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," It was so wild! We told em we were the Gundersons in
16"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, (laughing) I spit on her!
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, (to Lisa) <i>Operation</i>. You had a fun one.
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, Oh yeah!
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, With <i>Operation</i>.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer."
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe," Oh-ooh, and I brought <i>Operation</i>, but umm I lost the umm (It
starts buzzing) Its making a noise."
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, But le Blanc really doesnt mess up much.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," You dont verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up."
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," I have had some clumsy moments, I guess you can call em."
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa," He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And
he(laughs)he was afraid he was gonna fall down"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan, You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he
didnt fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney," This particular time when he continued to fall or yknow, try not
to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, ""Should I do it?"""
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands her
one.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe," Ooh, <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>!"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes
you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if somethings naturally
going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?"
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, I dont necessarily like to juice things
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, He said true or false!
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, Oh! Ooh-ooh!
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, What are you doing?!
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, Youre still a tiny bit on fire there.
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
0,season7,outtakes,Monica," Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me
that?"
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler, What the fu(beep)ck are you doing?!
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a
monkey"
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, That damn monkey.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan, That damn monkey.
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel," Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? Thats Dr.
Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)Okay.
(And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.) "
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer," Katie. Geez! See Katie, come hereKatie! (Katie spills some
popcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where shes supposed to.) Very
good."
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer," Lisas laugh thoughTheresIts so
infectious. Its one of those thingsjust forget about it. Once it starts,
its all gone."
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel," No yknow, I dont want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet
paper towels here!"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, Well at Monicas you can eat(Suddenly cracks up.)
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa," Okay, shh yeah. Cause its not silly."
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Here we go.
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Okay.
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Andaction!
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel, No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph (She starts laughing.)
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, (to Lisa) Ready?
0,season7,outtakes,Lisa, Yeah.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," And then it just builds on itself and theres no doing the scene
after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it."
0,season7,outtakes,David," For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-whenI
mean when"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan, (to Matt) You bastard.
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," Yeah, what did I do?"
0,season7,outtakes,David," I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to
you, or a certain take, I-II mean I find it so funny."
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, Mornin
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, Mornin
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor cant even say,
""Hmm, noodle soup?"""
0,season7,outtakes,Matt, Thats a good one? (They both laugh.)
0,season7,outtakes,David," Now, we should go back and take the other line."
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," Okay, Ill just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some more
on.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," I think, subconsciously"
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," (cracking up) Nope, you lost me."
0,season7,outtakes,David, No! Come on!
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start, you
walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on the
floor.) Ill be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, (jumping up) No! No! No!
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Well be right back with more <i>Friends</i>, less me."
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, Im doing my brother.
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, Thatsgross.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," You uh, youve worked withThey always say a performer should
never work with pets or children."
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer," Aww, the kids."
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Action.
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel, Okay. NowWhat is my first line?
0,season7,outtakes,Ben, (prompting her) What did we agree?
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Okay
0,season7,outtakes,David," The good thing about the young kids though, theyre completely
unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one
story"
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Oh little Ben.
0,season7,outtakes,David," Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to
hear my sons first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasnt
supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show"
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, Hi! Were visiting!
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel, Yay!
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Its Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Yknow, you
might as well say it because I told your"
0,season7,outtakes,Ben, DaDa.
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Can you say Da-Da? See, Im gonna tell your mommies you said it
anyway, so you might as well try"
0,season7,outtakes,Ben, DaDa.
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, Huh?
0,season7,outtakes,Ben, DaDa.
0,season7,outtakes,David," Yeah, hes saying Da-Da."
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," And then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like, the
scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time.
Like, do you remember that one where Monicas baking cookies in our old apartment?"
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Shes trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," Yeah, shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to
come hang out in her new place, and were sitting there eating pizza and I think it
was you (Points to Lisa) that said"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, What do I smell?
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," I think I was supposed to say, ""I dont know,"" and go over
and open the door. And I went"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, What do I smell?
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, (Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," (everyone laughs) And then it was like four takes later before we could
get through it with a straight face."
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, What do I smell?
0,season7,outtakes,David, Le Blanc.
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, What do I smell?
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," I dont know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the door
only to stop short and start laughing.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," But audiencesYou have a live studio audience and they must love
that. They must love it when they see you guys playing."
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler, What are you guys doing?
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, Nothing.
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, Nothin.
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," So that you will intentionally do something
thattheyll-theyll intentionally screw it up?"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, Yeah!
0,season7,outtakes,David, Yeah!
0,season7,outtakes,Matt, (noticing the laughter) Why? Whats the matter?
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," (to Courtney) You-youve worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of
people love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?"
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney, Im melting!
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney," They made me dance, in the fat suit."
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes
theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on. And
itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else."
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, That tastes like feet!
0,season7,outtakes,Matt, It tastes like (mimicking him in a high-pitched voice) feet!
0,season7,outtakes,David," Okay, were good."
0,season7,outtakes,The Director, Action!
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, That tastes like feet!
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and
youllwell be rehearsing during the week and you
justwhatever-whatever the joke is; its so funny we cant get through it
in rehearsal and just"
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, You just know.
0,season7,outtakes,Matt," You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, ""Okay show night,
Im justIll never be able to get through this."""
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, Are you saying that you dont want to get with this?
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler," You see, I dont say(Starts laughing.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe," (spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweet
Je(Beep)sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!"
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler, (noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! Shes purty!
0,season7,outtakes,Joey," Oh yeah, and shes really nice too! She taught me about yknow,
how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting."
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, Joey?
0,season7,outtakes,Rachel, Im sorry
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Excuse me, what?"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be;
there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a
scene."
0,season7,outtakes,David," Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a
staira very narrow New York stairwell and that was probablyI-I think it was
the hardest Ive-Ive laughed in my life period."
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He starts
laughing.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Ross, Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler, Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
0,season7,outtakes,David, Pivat!! (In a high pitched voice) Pivat!!!
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Youve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80
years from now youll be thinking about?"
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, It is when were able to crack each other up.
0,season7,outtakes,Chandler," Monicas gotta have the phone in the right place
and(Frantic babbling.)"
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," (To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We are
fixing it. "
0,season7,outtakes,David, Hes gone. Hes 
0,season7,outtakes,David," We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each others
performance, and we like each other."
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," Oh the bands ready! And wellI-Iwe gotta do what the band
says, right? I dont care about the stinkin band!!"
0,season7,outtakes,Conan," Okay <i>Friends</i> gang, thanks for doing it."
0,season7,outtakes,David, Well thank you so much.
0,season7,outtakes,Jennifer, Thank you Conan!
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew," Well thank you for coming here, its good to see you."
0,season7,outtakes,Phoebe, Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, Oh what are doing?!
0,season7,outtakes,Joey, Youre still a tiny bit on fire there!
0,season7,outtakes,Monica, I think you got it!
0,season7,outtakes,Courtney," Im sorry, I messed up."
0,season7,outtakes,Matt, Ill do it again and again if you want.
0,season7,outtakes,Ross," No-no! Ill-Ill (He takes too much and some falls out of
his mouth, which starts him laughing.)"
0,season7,outtakes,David, That is too much!
0,season7,outtakes,Matthew, Let me start that again.
